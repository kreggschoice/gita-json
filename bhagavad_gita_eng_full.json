There it says that one should read Bhagavad-gitavery scrutinizingly with the help of a person who is a devotee ofSriKrishnaand try to understand it without personally motivated interpretations. The example of clear understanding is there in the Bhagavad-gitaitself, in the way the teaching is understood byArjuna, who heard theGitadirectly from the Lord. If someone is fortunate enough to understand Bhagavad-gitain that line of disciplic succession, without motivated interpretation, then he surpasses all studies of Vedic wisdom, and all scriptures of the world. One will find in the Bhagavad-gitaall that is contained in other scriptures, but the reader will also find things which are not to be found elsewhere. That is the specific standard of theGita. It is the perfect theistic science because it is directly spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, LordSriKrishna."

He knew very well that his sons were equally blind in the matter of religion, and he was sure that they could never reach an understanding with the Pandavas, who were all pious since birth. Still he was doubtful about the influence of the place of pilgrimage, andSanjayacould understand his motive in asking about the situation on the battlefield.Sanjayawanted, therefore, to encourage the despondent king and thus assured him that his sons were not going to make any sort of compromise under the influence of the holy place.Sanjayatherefore informed the king that his son,Duryodhana, after seeing the military force of the Pandavas, at once went to the commander in chief, Dronacarya, to inform him of the real position. AlthoughDuryodhanais mentioned as the king, he still had to go to the commander on account of the seriousness of the situation. He was therefore quite fit to be a politician. ButDuryodhana's diplomatic veneer could not disguise the fear he felt when he saw the military arrangement of the Pandavas."

Dronacarya had some political quarrel with KingDrupada, the father ofDraupadi, who wasArjuna's wife. As a result of this quarrel,Drupadaperformed a great sacrifice, by which he received the benediction of having a son who would be able to kill Dronacarya. Dronacarya knew this perfectly well, and yet as a liberalbrahmanahe did not hesitate to impart all his military secrets when the son ofDrupada,Dhrishtadyumna, was entrusted to him for military education. Now, on the Battlefield ofKurukshetra,Dhrishtadyumnatook the side of the Pandavas, and it was he who arranged for their military phalanx, after having learned the art from Dronacarya.Duryodhanapointed out this mistake of Dronacarya's so that he might be alert and uncompromising in the fighting. By this he wanted to point out also that he should not be similarly lenient in battle against the Pandavas, who were also Dronacarya's affectionate students.Arjuna, especially, was his most affectionate and brilliant student.Duryodhanaalso warned that such leniency in the fight would lead to defeat."

He emphasized that Bhishmadeva was undoubtedly the greatest hero, but he was an old man, so everyone must especially think of his protection from all sides. He might become engaged in the fight, and the enemy might take advantage of his full engagement on one side. Therefore, it was important that other heroes not leave their strategic positions and allow the enemy to break the phalanx.Duryodhanaclearly felt that the victory of the Kurus depended on the presence of Bhishmadeva. He was confident of the full support of Bhishmadeva and Dronacarya in the battle because he well knew that they did not even speak a word whenArjuna's wifeDraupadi, in her helpless condition, had appealed to them for justice while she was being forced to appear naked in the presence of all the great generals in the assembly. Although he knew that the two generals had some sort of affection for the Pandavas, he hoped that these generals would now completely give it up, as they had done during the gambling performances."

Jayastupandu-putranamyeshampakshejanardanah. Victory is always with persons like the sons ofPandubecause LordKrishnais associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaitingArjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell ofVishnu, or LordKrishna. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated byAgni(the fire-god) toArjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds."

The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. The Lord, situated in the hearts of all living entities, directs their senses. But He directs in terms of the surrender of the living entity, and in the case of a pure devotee He directly controls the senses. Here on the Battlefield ofKurukshetrathe Lord directly controls the transcendental senses ofArjuna, and thus His particular name ofHrishikesa. The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name isMadhusudanabecause He killed the demon of the nameMadhu; His name isGovindabecause He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name isVasudevabecause He appeared as the son ofVasudeva; His name isDevaki-nandanabecause He acceptedDevakias His mother; His name isYasoda-nandanabecause He awarded His childhood pastimes toYasodaatVrindavana; His name isPartha-sarathibecause He worked as charioteer of His friendArjuna.

In all circumstances, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Hrishikesa, the Lord of the total senses. The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee's assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. Since He is master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him.

Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking ofKrishna's name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee ofKrishnacan conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking ofKrishnaconstantly. This is calledKrishnaconsciousness, orsamadhi. AsHrishikesa, or the director of the senses and mind of every living entity,Krishnacould understandArjuna's purpose in placing the chariot in the midst of the armies. Thus He did so, and spoke as follows."

As far as his soldiers were concerned, he was sympathetic from the beginning, but he felt compassion even for the soldiers of the opposite party, foreseeing their imminent death. And while he was so thinking, the limbs of his body began to quiver, and his mouth became dry. He was more or less astonished to see their fighting spirit. Practically the whole community, all blood relatives ofArjuna, had come to fight with him. This overwhelmed a kind devotee likeArjuna. Although it is not mentioned here, still one can easily imagine that not only wereArjuna's bodily limbs quivering and his mouth drying up, but he was also crying out of compassion. Such symptoms inArjunawere not due to weakness but to his softheartedness, a characteristic of a pure devotee of the Lord. It is said therefore:"

He thinks that by killing his kinsmen there would be no happiness in his life, and therefore he is not willing to fight, just as a person who does not feel hunger is not inclined to cook. He has now decided to go into the forest and live a secluded life in frustration. But as akshatriya, he requires a kingdom for his subsistence, because the kshatriyas cannot engage themselves in any other occupation.

                    "commentary": "Arjunahas addressed LordKrishnaasGovindabecauseKrishnais the object of all pleasures for cows and the senses. By using this significant word,Arjunaindicates thatKrishnashould understand what will satisfyArjuna's senses. ButGovindais not meant for satisfying our senses. If we try to satisfy the senses ofGovinda, however, then automatically our own senses are satisfied. Materially, everyone wants to satisfy his senses, and he wants God to be the order supplier for such satisfaction. The Lord will satisfy the senses of the living entities as much as they deserve, but not to the extent that they may covet. But when one takes the opposite way -- namely, when one tries to satisfy the senses ofGovindawithout desiring to satisfy one's own senses -- then by the grace ofGovindaall desires of the living entity are satisfied.Arjuna's deep affection for community and family members is exhibited here partly due to his natural compassion for them. He is therefore not prepared to fight. Everyone wants to show his opulence to friends and relatives, butArjunafears that all his relatives and friends will be killed on the battlefield and he will be unable to share his opulence after victory. This is a typical calculation of material life. The transcendental life, however, is different. Since a devotee wants to satisfy the desires of the Lord, he can, Lord willing, accept all kinds of opulence for the service of the Lord, and if the Lord is not willing, he should not accept a farthing.Arjunadid not want to kill his relatives, and if there were any need to kill them, he desired thatKrishnakill them personally. At this point he did not know thatKrishnahad already killed them before their coming into the battlefield and that he was only to become an instrument forKrishna. This fact is disclosed in following chapters. As a natural devotee of the Lord,Arjunadid not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord's plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, althoughArjunawanted to excuse them."

For example, LordRamawas so saintly that people even now are anxious to live in the kingdom of LordRama(rama-rajya), but LordRamanever showed any cowardice.Ravanawas an aggressor againstRamabecauseRavanakidnappedRama's wife,Sita, but LordRamagave him sufficient lessons, unparalleled in the history of the world. InArjuna's case, however, one should consider the special type of aggressors, namely his own grandfather, own teacher, friends, sons, grandsons, etc. Because of them,Arjunathought that he should not take the severe steps necessary against ordinary aggressors. Besides that, saintly persons are advised to forgive. Such injunctions for saintly persons are more important than any political emergency.Arjunaconsidered that rather than kill his own kinsmen for political reasons, it would be better to forgive them on grounds of religion and saintly behavior. He did not, therefore, consider such killing profitable simply for the matter of temporary bodily happiness. After all, kingdoms and pleasures derived therefrom are not permanent, so why should he risk his life and eternal salvation by killing his own kinsmen?Arjuna's addressing ofKrishnaas \"Madhava,\" or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out toKrishnathat, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induceArjunato take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune.Krishna, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees."

                    "commentary": "Good population in human society is the basic principle for peace, prosperity and spiritual progress in life. Thevarnasramareligion's principles were so designed that the good population would prevail in society for the general spiritual progress of state and community. Such population depends on the chastity and faithfulness of its womanhood. As children are very prone to be misled, women are similarly very prone to degradation. Therefore, both children and women require protection by the elder members of the family. By being engaged in various religious practices, women will not be misled into adultery. According to CanakyaPandita, women are generally not very intelligent and therefore not trustworthy. So the different family traditions of religious activities should always engage them, and thus their chastity and devotion will give birth to a good population eligible for participating in thevarnasramasystem. On the failure of suchvarnasrama-dharma, naturally the women become free to act and mix with men, and thus adultery is indulged in at the risk of unwanted population. Irresponsible men also provoke adultery in society, and thus unwanted children flood the human race at the risk of war and pestilence."

Sometimes the forefathers may be suffering from various types of sinful reactions, and sometimes some of them cannot even acquire a gross material body and are forced to remain in subtle bodies as ghosts. Thus, when remnants ofprasadamfood are offered to forefathers by descendants, the forefathers are released from ghostly or other kinds of miserable life. Such help rendered to forefathers is a family tradition, and those who are not in devotional life are required to perform such rituals. One who is engaged in the devotional life is not required to perform such actions. Simply by performing devotional service, one can deliver hundreds and thousands of forefathers from all kinds of misery. It is stated in theBhagavatam(11.5.41):"

Compassion for the dress of a drowning man is senseless. A man fallen in the ocean of nescience cannot be saved simply by rescuing his outward dress -- the gross material body. One who does not know this and laments for the outward dress is called asudra, or one who laments unnecessarily.Arjunawas akshatriya, and this conduct was not expected from him. LordKrishna, however, can dissipate the lamentation of the ignorant man, and for this purpose the Bhagavad-gitawas sung by Him. This chapter instructs us in self-realization by an analytical study of the material body and the spirit soul, as explained by the supreme authority, LordSriKrishna. This realization is possible when one works without attachment to fruitive results and is situated in the fixed conception of the real self."

Such kshatriyas and brahmanas are unworthy sons of their fathers; therefore,Krishnadid not wantArjunato become an unworthy son of akshatriya.Arjunawas the most intimate friend ofKrishna, andKrishnawas directly guiding him on the chariot; but in spite of all these credits, ifArjunaabandoned the battle he would be committing an infamous act. ThereforeKrishnasaid that such an attitude inArjunadid not fit his personality.Arjunamight argue that he would give up the battle on the grounds of his magnanimous attitude for the most respectableBhishmaand his relatives, butKrishnaconsidered that sort of magnanimity mere weakness of heart. Such false magnanimity was not approved by any authority. Therefore, such magnanimity or so-called nonviolence should be given up by persons likeArjunaunder the direct guidance ofKrishna."

If he did not conquer the enemy, begging would be his only means of subsistence. Nor was there certainty of victory, because either side might emerge victorious. Even if victory awaited them (and their cause was justified), still, if the sons ofDhritarashtradied in battle, it would be very difficult to live in their absence. Under the circumstances, that would be another kind of defeat for them. All these considerations byArjunadefinitely proved that not only was he a great devotee of the Lord but he was also highly enlightened and had complete control over his mind and senses. His desire to live by begging, although he was born in the royal household, is another sign of detachment. He was truly virtuous, as these qualities, combined with his faith in the words of instruction ofSriKrishna(his spiritual master), indicate. It is concluded thatArjunawas quite fit for liberation. Unless the senses are controlled, there is no chance of elevation to the platform of knowledge, and without knowledge and devotion there is no chance of liberation.Arjunawas competent in all these attributes, over and above his enormous attributes in his material relationships."

In every step there is perplexity, and therefore it behooves one to approach a bona fide spiritual master who can give one proper guidance for executing the purpose of life. All Vedic literatures advise us to approach a bona fide spiritual master to get free from the perplexities of life, which happen without our desire. They are like a forest fire that somehow blazes without being set by anyone. Similarly, the world situation is such' that perplexities of life automatically appear, without our wanting such confusion. No one wants fire, and yet it takes place, and we become perplexed. The Vedic wisdom therefore advises that in order to solve the perplexities of life and to understand the science of the solution, one must approach a spiritual master who is in the disciplic succession. A person with a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything. One should not, therefore, remain in material perplexities but should approach a spiritual master. This is the purport of this verse."

And because he was lacking in that knowledge, he should not have posed himself as a very learned man. As he did not happen to be a very learned man, he was consequently lamenting for something which was unworthy of lamentation. The body is born and is destined to be vanquished today or tomorrow; therefore the body is not as important as the soul.

SoBhishmaandDrona, being noble souls, were surely going to have spiritual bodies in the next life, or at least life in heavenly bodies for superior enjoyment of material existence. So, in either case, there was no cause of lamentation."

Similarly, to fight is the religious principle of the kshatriyas, and although one has to fight with some friend or relative, one should not deviate from his prescribed duty. One has to follow the prescribed rules and regulations of religious principles in order to rise up to the platform of knowledge, because by knowledge and devotion only can one liberate himself from the clutches ofmaya(illusion)."

But if anyone is able to tolerate such difficulties, surely his path to spiritual realization is complete. Similarly, inArjuna's discharge of duties as akshatriya, he is advised to persevere, even if it is difficult to fight with his family members or similarly beloved persons. LordCaitanyatooksannyasaat the age of twenty-four, and His dependents, young wife as well as old mother, had no one else to look after them.

There is no chance of maintaining it indefinitely. But the spirit soul is so minute that it cannot even be seen by an enemy, to say nothing of being killed. As mentioned in the previous verse, it is so small that no one can have any idea how to measure its dimension. So from both viewpoints there is no cause of lamentation, because the living entity as he is cannot be killed nor can the material body be saved for any length of time or permanently protected. The minute particle of the whole spirit acquires this material body according to his work, and therefore observance of religious principles should be utilized. In theVedanta-sutras the living entity is qualified as light because he is part and parcel of the supreme light. As sunlight maintains the entire universe, so the light of the soul maintains this material body. As soon as the spirit soul is out of this material body, the body begins to decompose; therefore it is the spirit soul which maintains this body. The body itself is unimportant.Arjunawas advised  to fight and not sacrifice the cause of religion for material, bodily considerations."

It takes its birth from the womb of the mother's body, remains for some time, grows, produces some effects, gradually dwindles, and at last vanishes into oblivion. The soul, however, does not go through such changes. The soul is not born, but, because he takes on a material body, the body takes its birth. The soul does not take birth there, and the soul does not die. Anything which has birth also has death. And because the soul has no birth, he therefore has no past, present or future. He is eternal, ever-existing, and primeval -- that is, there is no trace in history of his coming into being. Under the impression of the body, we seek the history of birth, etc., of the soul. The soul does not at any time become old, as the body does. The so-called old man, therefore, feels himself to be in the same spirit as in his childhood or youth. The changes of the body do not affect the soul. The soul does not deteriorate like a tree, nor anything material. The soul has no by-product either. The by-products of the body, namely children, are also different individual souls; and, owing to the body, they appear as children of a particular man. The body develops because of the soul's presence, but the soul has neither offshoots nor change. Therefore, the soul is free from the six changes of the body."

Similarly, violence also has its utility, and how to apply violence rests with the person in knowledge. Although the justice of the peace awards capital punishment to a person condemned for murder, the justice of the peace cannot be blamed, because he orders violence to another person according to the codes of justice. InManu-samhita, the lawbook for mankind, it is supported that a murderer should be condemned to death so that in his next life he will not have to suffer for the great sin he has committed. Therefore, the king's punishment of hanging a murderer is actually beneficial. Similarly, whenKrishnaorders fighting, it must be concluded that violence is for supreme justice, and thusArjunashould follow the instruction, knowing well that such violence, committed in the act of fighting forKrishna, is not violence at all because, at any rate, the man, or rather the soul, cannot be killed; so for the administration of justice, so-called violence is permitted.

After liberation from material contamination, the atomic soul may prefer to remain as a spiritual spark in the effulgent rays of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the intelligent souls enter into the spiritual planets to associate with the Personality of Godhead."

                    "commentary": "As described previously, the magnitude of the soul is so small for our material calculation that he cannot be seen even by the most powerful microscope; therefore, he is invisible. As far as the soul's existence is concerned, no one can establish his existence experimentally beyond the proof ofsruti, or Vedic wisdom. We have to accept this truth, because there is no other source of understanding the existence of the soul, although it is a fact by perception. There are many things we have to accept solely on grounds of superior authority. No one can deny the existence of his father, based upon the authority of his mother. There is no source of understanding the identity of the father except by the authority of the mother. Similarly, there is no source of understanding the soul except by studying the Vedas. In other words, the soul is inconceivable by human experimental knowledge. The soul is consciousness and conscious -- that also is the statement of the Vedas, and we have to accept that. Unlike the bodily changes, there is no change in the soul. As eternally unchangeable, the soul remains atomic in comparison to the infinite Supreme Soul. The Supreme Soul is infinite, and the atomic soul is infinitesimal. Therefore, the infinitesimal soul, being unchangeable, can never become equal to the infinite soul, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This concept is repeated in the Vedas in different ways just to confirm the stability of the conception of the soul. Repetition of something is necessary in order that we understand the matter thoroughly, without error."

When LordKrishnaspoke the Bhagavad-gita, it appears that such philosophers existed, and they were known as the lokayatikas and vaibhashikas. Such philosophers maintain that life symptoms take place at a certain mature condition of material combination. The modern material scientist and materialist philosophers also think similarly. According to them, the body is a combination of physical elements, and at a certain stage the life symptoms develop by interaction of the physical and chemical elements. The science of anthropology is based on this philosophy. Currently, many pseudo religions -- now becoming fashionable in America -- are also adhering to this philosophy, as well as to the nihilistic nondevotional Buddhist sects."

Nonbelievers in the existence of the soul are called atheists by followers of Vedic wisdom. Yet even if, for argument's sake, we accept this atheistic theory, there is still no cause for lamentation. Apart from the separate existence of the soul, the material elements remain unmanifested before creation. From this subtle state of nonmanifestation comes manifestation, just as from ether, air is generated; from air, fire is generated; from fire, water is generated; and from water, earth becomes manifested. From the earth, many varieties of manifestations take place. Take, for example, a big skyscraper manifested from the earth. When it is dismantled, the manifestation becomes again unmanifested and remains as atoms in the ultimate stage. The law of conservation of energy remains, but in course of time things are manifested and unmanifested -- that is the difference. Then what cause is there for lamentation either in the stage of manifestation or in unmanifestation? Somehow or other, even in the unmanifested stage, things are not lost. Both at the beginning and at the end, all elements remain unmanifested, and only in the middle are they manifested, and this does not make any real material difference."

                    "commentary": "According to the Nirukti, or the Vedic dictionary,sankhyameans that which describes things in detail, andsankhyarefers to that philosophy which describes the real nature of the soul. Andyogainvolves controlling the senses.Arjuna's proposal not to fight was based on sense gratification. Forgetting his prime duty, he wanted to cease fighting, because he thought that by not killing his relatives and kinsmen he would be happier than by enjoying the kingdom after conquering his cousins and brothers, the sons ofDhritarashtra. In both ways, the basic principles were for sense gratification. Happiness derived from conquering them and happiness derived by seeing kinsmen alive are both on the basis of personal sense gratification, even at a sacrifice of wisdom and duty.Krishna, therefore, wanted to explain toArjunathat by killing the body of his grandfather he would not be killing the soul proper, and He explained that all individual persons, including the Lord Himself, are eternal individuals; they were individuals in the past, they are individuals in the present, and they will continue to remain individuals in the future, because all of us are individual souls eternally. We simply change our bodily dress in different manners, but actually we keep our individuality even after liberation from the bondage of material dress. An analytical study of the soul and the body has been very graphically explained by LordKrishna. And this descriptive knowledge of the soul and the body from different angles of vision has been described here asSankhya, in terms of the Nirukti dictionary. ThisSankhyahas nothing to do withSankhyaphilosophy of the atheistKapila. Long before the imposterKapila'sSankhya, theSankhyaphilosophy was expounded in theSrimad-Bhagavatamby the true LordKapila, the incarnation of LordKrishna, who explained it to His mother,Devahuti. It is clearly explained by Him that thepurusha, or the Supreme Lord, is active and that He creates by looking over theprakriti. This is accepted in the Vedas and in theGita. The description in the Vedas indicates that the Lord glanced over theprakriti, or nature, and impregnated it with atomic individual souls. All these individuals are working in the material world for sense gratification, and under the spell of material energy they are thinking of being enjoyers. This mentality is dragged to the last point of liberation when the living entity wants to become one with the Lord. This is the last snare ofmaya, or sense gratificatory illusion, and it is only after many, many births of such sense gratificatory activities that a great soul surrenders untoVasudeva, LordKrishna, thereby fulfilling the search after the ultimate truth."

Gain or victory areKrishna's concern;Arjunais simply advised to act according to the dictation ofKrishna. The following ofKrishna's dictation is realyoga, and this is practiced in the process calledKrishnaconsciousness. ByKrishnaconsciousness only can one give up the sense of proprietorship. One has to become the servant ofKrishna, or the servant of the servant ofKrishna. That is the right way to discharge duty inKrishnaconsciousness, which alone can help one to act inyoga."

Except for work inKrishnaconsciousness, all activities are abominable because they continually bind the worker to the cycle of birth and death. One should therefore never desire to be the cause of work. Everything should be done inKrishnaconsciousness, for the satisfaction ofKrishna. Misers do not know how to utilize the assets of riches which they acquire by good fortune or by hard labor. One should spend all energies working inKrishnaconsciousness, and that will make one's life successful. Like misers, unfortunate persons do not employ their human energy in the service of the Lord."

Consequently, it is rightly said herein that one has to give up all kinds of sense desire manufactured by mental concoction. Artificially, such sense desires cannot be stopped. But if one is engaged inKrishnaconsciousness, then, automatically, sense desires subside without extraneous efforts. Therefore, one has to engage himself inKrishnaconsciousness without hesitation, for this devotional service will instantly help one onto the platform of transcendental consciousness. The highly developed soul always remains satisfied in himself by realizing himself as the eternal servitor of the Supreme Lord. Such a transcendentally situated person has no sense desires resulting from petty materialism; rather, he remains always happy in his natural position of eternally serving the Supreme Lord."

It is said that everymunihas a different angle of vision, and unless amunidiffers from other munis, he cannot be called amuniin the strict sense of the term. Nasav rishiryasyamatamnabhinnam(Mahabharata,Vana-parva313.117). But asthita-dhirmuni, as mentioned herein by the Lord, is different from an ordinarymuni. Thesthita-dhirmuniis always inKrishnaconsciousness, for he has exhausted all his business of creative speculation. He is calledprasanta-nihsesha-mano-rathantara (Stotra-ratna43), or one who has surpassed the stage of mental speculations and has come to the conclusion that LordSriKrishna, orVasudeva, is everything (vasudevahsarvamitisamahatmasu-durlabhah). He is called amunifixed in mind. Such a fullyKrishnaconscious person is not at all disturbed by the onslaughts of the threefold miseries, for he accepts all miseries as the mercy of the Lord, thinking himself only worthy of more trouble due to his past misdeeds; and he sees that his miseries, by the grace of the Lord, are minimized to the lowest. Similarly, when he is happy he gives credit to the Lord, thinking himself unworthy of the happiness; he realizes that it is due only to the Lord's grace that he is in such a comfortable condition and able to render better service to the Lord. And, for the service of the Lord, he is always daring and active and is not influenced by attachment or aversion. Attachment means accepting things for one's own sense gratification, and detachment is the absence of such sensual attachment. But one fixed inKrishnaconsciousness has neither attachment nor detachment because his life is dedicated in the service of the Lord. Consequently he is not at all angry even when his attempts are unsuccessful. Success or no success, aKrishnaconscious person is always steady in his determination."

The senses are compared to venomous serpents. They want to act very loosely and without restriction. Theyogi, or the devotee, must be very strong to control the serpents -- like a snake charmer. He never allows them to act independently. There are many injunctions in the revealed scriptures; some of them are do-not's, and some of them are do's. Unless one is able to follow the do's and the do-not's, restricting oneself from sense enjoyment, it is not possible to be firmly fixed inKrishnaconsciousness. The best example, set herein, is the tortoise. The tortoise can at any moment wind up his senses and exhibit them again at any time for particular purposes.

                    "commentary": "Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of eatables. The patient, however, neither likes such restrictions nor loses his taste for eatables. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like ashtanga-yoga, in the matter ofyama,niyama,asana,pranayama, pratyahara,dharana,dhyana, etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme LordKrishna, in the course of his advancement inKrishnaconsciousness, no longer has a taste for dead, material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good until one actually has a taste forKrishnaconsciousness. When one is actuallyKrishnaconscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."

The senses require real engagements, and if they are not engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, they will certainly seek engagement in the service of materialism. In the material world everyone, including LordSivaand LordBrahma-- to say nothing of other demigods in the heavenly planets -- is subjected to the influence of sense objects, and the only method to get out of this puzzle of material existence is to becomeKrishnaconscious. LordSivawas deep in meditation, but whenParvatiagitated him for sense pleasure, he agreed to the proposal, and as a result Kartikeya was born. WhenHaridasaThakurawas a young devotee of the Lord, he was similarly allured by the incarnation ofMaya-devi, butHaridasaeasily passed the test because of his unalloyed devotion to LordKrishna. As illustrated in the above-mentioned verse ofSriYamunacarya, a sincere devotee of the Lord shuns all material sense enjoyment due to his higher taste for spiritual enjoyment in the association of the Lord. That is the secret of success. One who is not, therefore, inKrishnaconsciousness, however powerful he may be in controlling the senses by artificial repression, is sure ultimately to fail, for the slightest thought of sense pleasure will agitate him to gratify his desires."

TheKrishnaconscious person is concerned only with the satisfaction ofKrishna, and nothing else. Therefore he is transcendental to all attachment and detachment. IfKrishnawants, the devotee can do anything which is ordinarily undesirable; and ifKrishnadoes not want, he shall not do that which he would have ordinarily done for his own satisfaction. Therefore to act or not to act is within his control because he acts only under the direction ofKrishna.

Therefore, if one is not inKrishnaconsciousness, there cannot be a final goal for the mind. Disturbance is due to want of an ultimate goal, and when one is certain thatKrishnais the enjoyer, proprietor and friend of everyone and everything, then one can, with a steady mind, bring about peace. Therefore, one who is engaged without a relationship withKrishnais certainly always in distress and is without peace, however much he may make a show of peace and spiritual advancement in life.Krishnaconsciousness is a self-manifested peaceful condition which can be achieved only in relationship withKrishna."

AKrishnaconscious man is not in need of anything, because the Lord fulfills all his material necessities. Therefore he is like the ocean -- always full in himself. Desires may come to him like the waters of the rivers that flow into the ocean, but he is steady in his activities, and he is not even slightly disturbed by desires for sense gratification.

Others, however, who want to fulfill desires even up to the limit of liberation, what to speak of material success, never attain peace.

But the person inKrishnaconsciousness is happy in the service of the Lord, and he has no desires to be fulfilled. In fact, he does not even desire liberation from the so-called material bondage. The devotees ofKrishnahave no material desires, and therefore they are in perfect peace."

                    "commentary": "To become desireless means not to desire anything for sense gratification. In other words, desire for becomingKrishnaconscious is actually desirelessness. To understand one's actual position as the eternal servitor ofKrishna, without falsely claiming this material body to be oneself and without falsely claiming proprietorship over anything in the world, is the perfect stage ofKrishnaconsciousness. One who is situated in this perfect stage knows that becauseKrishnais the proprietor of everything, everything must be used for the satisfaction ofKrishna.Arjunadid not want to fight for his own sense satisfaction, but when he became fullyKrishnaconscious he fought becauseKrishnawanted him to fight. For himself there was no desire to fight, but forKrishnathe sameArjunafought to his best ability. Real desirelessness is desire for the satisfaction ofKrishna, not an artificial attempt to abolish desires. The living entity cannot be desireless or senseless, but he does have to change the quality of the desires. A materially desireless person certainly knows that everything belongs toKrishna(isavasyamidamsarvam), and therefore he does not falsely claim proprietorship over anything. This transcendental knowledge is based on self-realization -- namely, knowing perfectly well that every living entity is an eternal part and parcel ofKrishnain spiritual identity, and that the eternal position of the living entity is therefore never on the level ofKrishnaor greater than Him. This understanding ofKrishnaconsciousness is the basic principle of real peace."

It is only a matter of understanding and accepting the fact.KhatvangaMaharajaattained this state of life just a few minutes before his death, by surrendering untoKrishna.Nirvanameans ending the process of materialistic life. According to Buddhist philosophy, there is only void after the completion of this material life, but Bhagavad-gitateaches differently. Actual life begins after the completion of this material life. For the gross materialist it is sufficient to know that one has to end this materialistic way of life, but for persons who are spiritually advanced, there is another life after this materialistic life. Before ending this life, if one fortunately becomesKrishnaconscious, he at once attains the stage ofbrahma-nirvana. There is no difference between the kingdom of God and the devotional service of the Lord. Since both of them are on the absolute plane, to be engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord is to have attained the spiritual kingdom. In the material world there are activities of sense gratification, whereas in the spiritual world there are activities ofKrishnaconsciousness. Attainment ofKrishnaconsciousness even during this life is immediate attainment ofBrahman, and one who is situated inKrishnaconsciousness has certainly already entered into the kingdom of God."

And the path of realization has been recommended:buddhi-yoga, orKrishnaconsciousness. SometimesKrishnaconsciousness is misunderstood to be inertia, and one with such a misunderstanding often withdraws to a secluded place to become fullyKrishnaconscious by chanting the holy name of LordKrishna. But without being trained in the philosophy ofKrishnaconsciousness, it is not advisable to chant the holy name ofKrishnain a secluded place, where one may acquire only cheap adoration from the innocent public.Arjunaalso thought ofKrishnaconsciousness orbuddhi-yoga, or intelligence in spiritual advancement of knowledge, as something like retirement from active life and the practice of penance and austerity at a secluded place. In other words, he wanted to skillfully avoid the fighting by usingKrishnaconsciousness as an excuse. But as a sincere student, he placed the matter before his master and questionedKrishnaas to his best course of action. In answer, LordKrishnaelaborately explainedkarma-yoga, or work inKrishnaconsciousness, in this Third Chapter."

This was all presented unsystematically. A more organized outline of the path would be necessary for action and understanding.Arjuna, therefore, wanted to clear up these apparently confusing matters so that any common man could accept them without misinterpretation. AlthoughKrishnahad no intention of confusingArjunaby any jugglery of words,Arjunacould not follow the process ofKrishnaconsciousness -- either by inertia or by active service. In other words, by his questions he is clearing the path ofKrishnaconsciousness for all students who seriously want to understand the mystery of the Bhagavad-gita."

                    "commentary": "In the Second Chapter, verse 39, the Lord explained two kinds of procedures -- namelysankhya-yogaandkarma-yoga, orbuddhi-yoga. In this verse, the Lord explains the same more clearly.Sankhya-yoga, or the analytical study of the nature of spirit and matter, is the subject matter for persons who are inclined to speculate and understand things by experimental knowledge and philosophy. The other class of men work inKrishnaconsciousness, as it is explained in the 61st verse of the Second Chapter. The Lord has explained, also in the 39th verse, that by working by the principles ofbuddhi-yoga, orKrishnaconsciousness, one can be relieved from the bonds of action; and, furthermore, there is no flaw in the process. The same principle is more clearly explained in the 61st verse -- that thisbuddhi-yogais to depend entirely on the Supreme (or more specifically, onKrishna), and in this way all the senses can be brought under control very easily. Therefore, both the yogas are interdependent, as religion and philosophy. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, or sometimes fanaticism, while philosophy without religion is mental speculation. The ultimate goal isKrishna, because the philosophers who are also sincerely searching after the Absolute Truth come in the end toKrishnaconsciousness. This is also stated in the Bhagavad-gita. The whole process is to understand the real position of the self in relation to the Superself. The indirect process is philosophical speculation, by which, gradually, one may come to the point ofKrishnaconsciousness; and the other process is directly connecting with everything inKrishnaconsciousness. Of these two, the path ofKrishnaconsciousness is better because it does not depend on purifying the senses by a philosophical process.Krishnaconsciousness is itself the purifying process, and by the direct method of devotional service it is simultaneously easy and sublime."

As such, the spirit soul has to be engaged in the good work ofKrishnaconsciousness, otherwise it will be engaged in occupations dictated by illusory energy.

For one who cannot understand what the Personality of Godhead is, sacrifice to the demigods is recommended. According to the different material qualities of the persons concerned, different types of yajnas are recommended in the Vedas. Worship of different demigods is also on the same basis -- namely, according to different qualities. For example, the meat-eaters are recommended to worship the goddessKali, the ghastly form of material nature, and before the goddess the sacrifice of animals is recommended. But for those who are in the mode of goodness, the transcendental worship ofVishnuis recommended. But ultimately all yajnas are meant for gradual promotion to the transcendental position. For ordinary men, at least five yajnas, known aspanca-maha-yajna, are necessary."

The santas, being always in a compact of love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Govinda(the giver of all pleasures), orMukunda(the giver of liberation), orKrishna(the all-attractive person), cannot accept anything without first offering it to the Supreme Person. Therefore, such devotees always perform yajnas in different modes of devotional service, such assravanam,kirtanam,smaranam,arcanam, etc., and these performances of yajnas keep them always aloof from all kinds of contamination of sinful association in the material world. Others, who prepare food for self or sense gratification, are not only thieves but also the eaters of all kinds of sins. How can a person be happy if he is both a thief and sinful? It is not possible. Therefore, in order for people to become happy in all respects, they must be taught to perform the easy process ofsankirtana-yajna, in fullKrishnaconsciousness.

The Supreme Lord, who is known as theyajna-purusha, or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all the demigods, who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods likeIndra,CandraandVarunaare appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the Vedas direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When LordKrishnais worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods. For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are inKrishnaconsciousness, offer food toKrishnaand then eat -- a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to LordVishnuand then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person inKrishnaconsciousness, who eats only food offered toKrishna, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins. The material world is full of contaminations, and one who is immunized by acceptingprasadamof the Lord (food offered toVishnu) is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination."

                    "commentary": "Yajnartha-karma, or the necessity of work for the satisfaction ofKrishnaonly, is more expressly stated in this verse. If we have to work for the satisfaction of theyajna-purusha,Vishnu, then we must find out the direction of work inBrahman, or the transcendental Vedas. The Vedas are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed without the direction of the Vedas is calledvikarma, or unauthorized or sinful work. Therefore, one should always take direction from the Vedas to be saved from the reaction of work. As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, one similarly has to work under direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such directions in the Vedas are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said,asyamahatobhutasyanisvasitam etadyadrig-vedo yajur-vedahsamavedo 'tharvangirasah. \"The four Vedas -- namely theRigVeda, YajurVeda,SamaVeda, andAtharvaVeda-- are all emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead.\" (Brihad-aranyakaUpanishad4.5.11) The Lord, being omnipotent, can speak by breathing air, for as it is confirmed in theBrahma-samhita, the Lord has the omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing, and He can impregnate by His eyes. In fact, it is said that He glanced over material nature and thus fathered all living entities. After creating or impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of material nature, He gave His directions in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment. But the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one's perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation; therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process ofyajnaby becomingKrishnaconscious. Even those who have not followed the Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles ofKrishnaconsciousness, and that will take the place of performance of Vedic yajnas, or karmas."

Therefore, for those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of performing yajnas is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature's law, this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization, in either of the three ways -- namelykarma-yoga,jnana-yoga, orbhakti-yoga. There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed yajnas for the transcendentalists who are above vice and virtue; but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above mentioned cycle ofyajnaperformances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are notKrishnaconscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness; therefore they need to execute pious work. Theyajnasystem is planned in such a way that sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reaction of sense-gratificatory work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore, the yajnas are directly aimed at the particular demigods mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice ofKrishnaconsciousness, because when one masters the performance of yajnas one is sure to becomeKrishnaconscious. But if by performing yajnas one does not becomeKrishnaconscious, such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, therefore, limit his progress only to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them, to attainKrishnaconsciousness."

LordKrishnaandArjuna, the Lord's eternal friend, had no need to fight in the Battle ofKurukshetra, but they fought to teach people in general that violence is also necessary in a situation where good arguments fail. Before the Battle ofKurukshetra, every effort was made to avoid the war, even by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but the other party was determined to fight. So for such a right cause, there is a necessity for fighting. Although one who is situated inKrishnaconsciousness may not have any interest in the world, he still works to teach the public how to live and how to act. Experienced persons inKrishnaconsciousness can act in such a way that others will follow, and this is explained in the following verse."

Therefore, a teacher must follow the principles ofsastra(scripture) to teach the common man. The teacher cannot manufacture rules against the principles of revealed scriptures. The revealed scriptures, likeManu-samhitaand similar others, are considered the standard books to be followed by human society. Thus the leader's teaching should be based on the principles of such standard sastras. One who desires to improve himself must follow the standard rules as they are practiced by the great teachers. TheSrimad-Bhagavatamalso affirms that one should follow in the footsteps of great devotees, and that is the way of progress on the path of spiritual realization. The king or the executive head of a state, the father and the school teacher are all considered to be natural leaders of the innocent people in general.

                    "commentary": "This verse clearly indicates the purpose of the Bhagavad-gita. The Lord instructs that one has to become fullyKrishnaconscious to discharge duties, as if in military discipline. Such an injunction may make things a little difficult; nevertheless duties must be carried out, with dependence onKrishna, because that is the constitutional position of the living entity. The living entity cannot be happy independent of the cooperation of the Supreme Lord, because the eternal constitutional position of the living entity is to become subordinate to the desires of the Lord.Arjunawas therefore ordered bySriKrishnato fight as if the Lord were his military commander. One has to sacrifice everything for the good will of the Supreme Lord, and at the same time discharge prescribed duties without claiming proprietorship.Arjunadid not have to consider the order of the Lord; he had only to execute His order. The Supreme Lord is the soul of all souls; therefore, one who depends solely and wholly on the Supreme Soul without personal consideration, or in other words, one who is fullyKrishnaconscious, is calledadhyatma-cetas.Nirasihmeans that one has to act on the order of the master but should not expect fruitive results. The cashier may count millions of dollars for his employer, but he does not claim a cent for himself. Similarly, one has to realize that nothing in the world belongs to any individual person, but that everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. That is the real purport ofmayi, or \"unto Me.\" And when one acts in suchKrishnaconsciousness, certainly he does not claim proprietorship over anything. This consciousness is called nirmama, or \"nothing is mine.\" And if there is any reluctance to execute such a stern order, which is without consideration of so-called kinsmen in the bodily relationship, that reluctance should be thrown off; in this way one may becomevigata-jvara, or without feverish mentality or lethargy. Everyone, according to his quality and position, has a particular type of work to discharge, and all such duties may be discharged inKrishnaconsciousness, as described above. That will lead one to the path of liberation."

There are many philosophers who write comments on the Bhagavad-gitabut have no faith inKrishna. They will never be liberated from the bondage of fruitive action. But an ordinary man with firm faith in the eternal injunctions of the Lord, even though unable to execute such orders, becomes liberated from the bondage of the law ofkarma.

Therefore, even for the most highly educated person on the mundane plane, it is impossible to get out of the entanglement ofmayasimply by theoretical knowledge, or by separating the soul from the body. There are many so-called spiritualists who outwardly pose as advanced in the science but inwardly or privately are completely under particular modes of nature which they are unable to surpass. Academically, one may be very learned, but because of his long association with material nature, he is in bondage.Krishnaconsciousness helps one to get out of the material entanglement, even though one may be engaged in his prescribed duties in terms of material existence. Therefore, without being fully inKrishnaconsciousness, one should not give up his occupational duties. No one should suddenly give up his prescribed duties and become a so-calledyogior transcendentalist artificially. It is better to be situated in one's position and to try to attainKrishnaconsciousness under superior training. Thus one may be freed from the clutches ofKrishna'smaya."

                    "commentary": "Those who are inKrishnaconsciousness are naturally reluctant to engage in material sense gratification. But those who are not in such consciousness should follow the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures. Unrestricted sense enjoyment is the cause of material encagement, but one who follows the rules and regulations of the revealed scriptures does not become entangled by the sense objects. For example, sex enjoyment is a necessity for the conditioned soul, and sex enjoyment is allowed under the license of marriage ties. According to scriptural injunctions, one is forbidden to engage in sex relationships with any women other than one's wife. All other women are to be considered as one's mother. But in spite of such injunctions, a man is still inclined to have sex relationships with other women. These propensities are to be curbed; otherwise they will be stumbling blocks on the path of self-realization. As long as the material body is there, the necessities of the material body are allowed, but under rules and regulations. And yet, we should not rely upon the control of such allowances. One has to follow those rules and regulations, unattached to them, because practice of sense gratification under regulations may also lead one to go astray -- as much as there is always the chance of an accident, even on the royal roads. Although they may be very carefully maintained, no one can guarantee that there will be no danger even on the safest road. The sense enjoyment spirit has been current a very long, long time, owing to material association. Therefore, in spite of regulated sense enjoyment, there is every chance of falling down; therefore any attachment for regulated sense enjoyment must also be avoided by all means. But attachment toKrishnaconsciousness, or acting always in the loving service ofKrishna, detaches one from all kinds of sensory activities. Therefore, no one should try to be detached fromKrishnaconsciousness at any stage of life. The whole purpose of detachment from all kinds of sense attachment is ultimately to become situated on the platform ofKrishnaconsciousness."

                    "commentary": "One should therefore discharge his prescribed duties in fullKrishnaconsciousness rather than those prescribed for others. Materially, prescribed duties are duties enjoined according to one's psychophysical condition, under the spell of the modes of material nature. Spiritual duties are as ordered by the spiritual master for the transcendental service ofKrishna. But whether material or spiritual, one should stick to his prescribed duties even up to death, rather than imitate another's prescribed duties. Duties on the spiritual platform and duties on the material platform may be different, but the principle of following the authorized direction is always good for the performer. When one is under the spell of the modes of material nature, one should follow the prescribed rules for his particular situation and should not imitate others. For example, abrahmana, who is in the mode of goodness, is nonviolent, whereas akshatriya, who is in the mode of passion, is allowed to be violent. As such, for akshatriyait is better to be vanquished following the rules of violence than to imitate abrahmanawho follows the principles of nonviolence. Everyone has to cleanse his heart by a gradual process, not abruptly. However, when one transcends the modes of material nature and is fully situated inKrishnaconsciousness, he can perform anything and everything under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. In that complete stage ofKrishnaconsciousness, thekshatriyamay act as abrahmana, or abrahmanamay act as akshatriya. In the transcendental stage, the distinctions of the material world do not apply. For example,Visvamitrawas originally akshatriya, but later on he acted as abrahmana, whereasParasuramawas abrahmanabut later on he acted as akshatriya. Being transcendentally situated, they could do so; but as long as one is on the material platform, he must perform his duties according to the modes of material nature. At the same time, he must have a full sense ofKrishnaconsciousness."

Then again, when lust is unsatisfied, it turns into wrath; wrath is transformed into illusion, and illusion continues the material existence. Therefore, lust is the greatest enemy of the living entity, and it is lust only which induces the pure living entity to remain entangled in the material world. Wrath is the manifestation of the mode of ignorance; these modes exhibit themselves as wrath and other corollaries. If, therefore, the mode of passion, instead of being degraded into the mode of ignorance, is elevated to the mode of goodness by the prescribed method of living and acting, then one can be saved from the degradation of wrath by spiritual attachment."

                    "commentary": "There are three degrees of covering of the living entity by which his pure consciousness is obscured. This covering is but lust under different manifestations like smoke in the fire, dust on the mirror, and the womb about the embryo. When lust is compared to smoke, it is understood that the fire of the living spark can be a little perceived. In other words, when the living entity exhibits hisKrishnaconsciousness slightly, he may be likened to the fire covered by smoke. Although fire is necessary where there is smoke, there is no overt manifestation of fire in the early stage. This stage is like the beginning ofKrishnaconsciousness. The dust on the mirror refers to a cleansing process of the mirror of the mind by so many spiritual methods. The best process is to chant the holy names of the Lord. The embryo covered by the womb is an analogy illustrating a helpless position, for the child in the womb is so helpless that he cannot even move. This stage of living condition can be compared to that of the trees. The trees are also living entities, but they have been put in such a condition of life by such a great exhibition of lust that they are almost void of all consciousness. The covered mirror is compared to the birds and beasts, and the smoke-covered fire is compared to the human being. In the form of a human being, the living entity may revive a littleKrishnaconsciousness, and, if he makes further development, the fire of spiritual life can be kindled in the human form of life. By careful handling of the smoke in the fire, fire can be made to blaze. Therefore the human form of life is a chance for the living entity to escape the entanglement of material existence. In the human form of life, one can conquer the enemy, lust, by cultivation ofKrishnaconsciousness under able guidance."

In the ordinary prison house, criminals are kept within bars; similarly, the criminals who are disobedient to the laws of the Lord are shackled by sex life. Advancement of material civilization on the basis of sense gratification means increasing the duration of the material existence of a living entity. Therefore, this lust is the symbol of ignorance by which the living entity is kept within the material world. While one enjoys sense gratification, it may be that there is some feeling of happiness, but actually that so-called feeling of happiness is the ultimate enemy of the sense enjoyer."

Mind is the center of all the activities of the senses, and thus when we hear about sense objects the mind generally becomes a reservoir of all ideas of sense gratification; and, as a result, the mind and the senses become the repositories of lust. Next, the intelligence department becomes the capital of such lustful propensities. Intelligence is the immediate next-door neighbor of the spirit soul. Lusty intelligence influences the spirit soul to acquire the false ego and identify itself with matter, and thus with the mind and senses. The spirit soul becomes addicted to enjoying the material senses and mistakes this as true happiness. This false identification of the spirit soul is very nicely explained in theSrimad-Bhagavatam(10.84.13):"

                    "commentary": "The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, orKrishnaconsciousness. InKrishnaconsciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the hierarchy of bodily functions, as described here, ultimately ends in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act -- as it does during dreaming. But above the mind is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and senses, will be automatically engaged. In theKathaUpanishadthere is a similar passage, in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance that the senses will become engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained.paramdrishtvanivartate. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In theKathaUpanishadthe soul has been described asmahan, the great. Therefore the soul is above all -- namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem."

In the material existence of life, one is certainly influenced by propensities for lust and desire for dominating the resources of material nature. Desire for overlording and for sense gratification is the greatest enemy of the conditioned soul; but by the strength ofKrishnaconsciousness, one can control the material senses, the mind and the intelligence. One may not give up work and prescribed duties all of a sudden; but by gradually developingKrishnaconsciousness, one can be situated in a transcendental position without being influenced by the material senses and the mind -- by steady intelligence directed toward one's pure identity. This is the sum total of this chapter. In the immature stage of material existence, philosophical speculations and artificial attempts to control the senses by the so-called practice of yogic postures can never help a man toward spiritual life. He must be trained inKrishnaconsciousness by higher intelligence."

                    "commentary": "It is clearly stated that theGitawas especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly Bhagavad-gitawas never meant for the demonic persons, who would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of theGitaappeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of theGita(especially in English), but almost all of them are not according to authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Krishna, although they make a good business on the words ofSriKrishna. This spirit is demonic, because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of theGitain English, as it is received by theparampara(disciplic succession) system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. Bhagavad-gita-- accepted as it is -- is a great boon to humanity; but if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."

                    "commentary": "Arjunais an accepted devotee of the Lord, so how could he not believeKrishna's words? The fact is thatArjunais not inquiring for himself but for those who do not believe in the Supreme Personality of Godhead or for the demons who do not like the idea thatKrishnashould be accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead; for them onlyArjunainquires on this point, as if he were himself not aware of the Personality of Godhead, orKrishna. As it will be evident from the Tenth Chapter,Arjunaknew perfectly well thatKrishnais the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of everything and the last word in transcendence. Of course,Krishnaalso appeared as the son ofDevakion this earth. HowKrishnaremained the same Supreme Personality of Godhead, the eternal original person, is very difficult for an ordinary man to understand. Therefore, to clarify this point,Arjunaput this question beforeKrishnaso that He Himself could speak authoritatively. ThatKrishnais the supreme authority is accepted by the whole world, not only at present but from time immemorial, and the demons alone reject Him. Anyway, sinceKrishnais the authority accepted by all,Arjunaput this question before Him in order thatKrishnawould describe Himself without being depicted by the demons, who always try to distort Him in a way understandable to the demons and their followers. It is necessary that everyone, for his own interest, know the science ofKrishna. Therefore, whenKrishnaHimself speaks about Himself, it is auspicious for all the worlds. To the demons, such explanations byKrishnaHimself may appear to be strange because the demons always studyKrishnafrom their own standpoint, but those who are devotees heartily welcome the statements ofKrishnawhen they are spoken byKrishnaHimself. The devotees will always worship such authoritative statements ofKrishnabecause they are always eager to know more and more about Him. The atheists, who considerKrishnaan ordinary man, may in this way come to know thatKrishnais superhuman, that He is sac-cid-ananda-vigraha[Bs. 5.1] -- the eternal form of bliss and knowledge -- that He is transcendental, and that He is above the domination of the modes of material nature and above the influence of time and space. A devotee ofKrishna, likeArjuna, is undoubtedly above any misunderstanding of the transcendental position ofKrishna.Arjuna's putting this question before the Lord is simply an attempt by the devotee to defy the atheistic attitude of persons who considerKrishnato be an ordinary human being, subject to the modes of material nature."

If someone is asked what he did exactly at the same time one day earlier, it would be very difficult for a common man to answer immediately. He would surely have to dredge his memory to recall what he was doing exactly at the same time one day before. And yet, men often dare claim to be God, orKrishna. One should not be misled by such meaningless claims. Then again, the Lord explains Hisprakriti, or His form.Prakritimeans \"nature,\" as well assvarupa, or \"one's own form.\" The Lord says that He appears in His own body. He does not change His body, as the common living entity changes from one body to another. The conditioned soul may have one kind of body in the present birth, but he has a different body in the next birth. In the material world, the living entity has no fixed body but transmigrates from one body to another. The Lord, however, does not do so. Whenever He appears, He does so in the same original body, by His internal potency. In other words,Krishnaappears in this material world in His original eternal form, with two hands, holding a flute. He appears exactly in His eternal body, uncontaminated by this material world. Although He appears in the same transcendental body and is Lord of the universe, it still appears that He takes His birth like an ordinary living entity. And although His body does not deteriorate like a material body, it still appears that LordKrishnagrows from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth. But astonishingly enough He never ages beyond youth. At the time of the Battle ofKurukshetra, He had many grandchildren at home; or, in other words, He had sufficiently aged by material calculations. Still He looked just like a young man twenty or twenty-five years old. We never see a picture ofKrishnain old age because He never grows old like us, although He is the oldest person in the whole creation -- past, present, and future. Neither His body nor His intelligence ever deteriorates or changes. Therefore, it is clear that in spite of His being in the material world, He is the same unborn, eternal form of bliss and knowledge, changeless in His transcendental body and intelligence. Factually, His appearance and disappearance is like the sun's rising, moving before us, and then disappearing from our eyesight. When the sun is out of sight, we think that the sun is set, and when the sun is before our eyes, we think that the sun is on the horizon. Actually, the sun is always in its fixed position, but owing to our defective, insufficient senses, we calculate the appearance and disappearance of the sun in the sky. And because LordKrishna's appearance and disappearance are completely different from that of any ordinary, common living entity, it is evident that He is eternal, blissful knowledge by His internal potency -- and He is never contaminated by material nature. The Vedas also confirm that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is unborn yet He still appears to take His birth in multimanifestations. The Vedic supplementary literatures also confirm that even though the Lord appears to be taking His birth, He is still without change of body. In theBhagavatam, He appears before His mother asNarayana, with four hands and the decorations of the six kinds of full opulences. His appearance in His original eternal form is His causeless mercy, bestowed upon the living entities so that they can concentrate on the Supreme Lord as He is, and not on mental concoctions or imaginations, which the impersonalist wrongly thinks the Lord's forms to be. The wordmaya, oratma-maya, refers to the Lord's causeless mercy, according to theVisva-kosadictionary. The Lord is conscious of all of His previous appearances and disappearances, but a common living entity forgets everything about his past body as soon as he gets another body. He is the Lord of all living entities because He performs wonderful and superhuman activities while He is on this earth. Therefore, the Lord is always the same Absolute Truth and is without differentiation between His form and self, or between His quality and body. A question may now be raised as to why the Lord appears and disappears in this world. This is explained in the next verse."

                    "commentary": "The wordsrijamiis significant herein.Srijamicannot be used in the sense of creation, because, according to the previous verse, there is no creation of the Lord's form or body, since all of the forms are eternally existent. Therefore,srijamimeans that the Lord manifests Himself as He is. Although the Lord appears on schedule, namely at the end of theDvapara-yugaof the twenty-eighth millennium of the seventhManuin one day ofBrahma, He has no obligation to adhere to such rules and regulations, because He is completely free to act in many ways at His will. He therefore appears by His own will whenever there is a predominance of irreligiosity and a disappearance of true religion. Principles of religion are laid down in the Vedas, and any discrepancy in the matter of properly executing the rules of the Vedas makes one irreligious. In theBhagavatamit is stated that such principles are the laws of the Lord. Only the Lord can manufacture a system of religion. The Vedas are also accepted as originally spoken by the Lord Himself toBrahma, from within his heart. Therefore, the principles ofdharma, or religion, are the direct orders of the Supreme Personality of Godhead (dharmamtusakshadbhagavat-pranitam[SB 6.3.19]). These principles are clearly indicated throughout the Bhagavad-gita. The purpose of the Vedas is to establish such principles under the order of the Supreme Lord, and the Lord directly orders, at the end of theGita, that the highest principle of religion is to surrender unto Him only, and nothing more. The Vedic principles push one towards complete surrender unto Him; and whenever such principles are disturbed by the demoniac, the Lord appears. From theBhagavatamwe understand that LordBuddhais the incarnation ofKrishnawho appeared when materialism was rampant and materialists were using the pretext of the authority of the Vedas. Although there are certain restrictive rules and regulations regarding animal sacrifice for particular purposes in the Vedas, people of demonic tendency still took to animal sacrifice without reference to the Vedic principles. LordBuddhaappeared to stop this nonsense and to establish the Vedic principles of nonviolence. Therefore each and everyavatara, or incarnation of the Lord, has a particular mission, and they are all described in the revealed scriptures. No one should be accepted as anavataraunless he is referred to by scriptures. It is not a fact that the Lord appears only on Indian soil. He can manifest Himself anywhere and everywhere, and whenever He desires to appear. In each and every incarnation, He speaks as much about religion as can be understood by the particular people under their particular circumstances. But the mission is the same -- to lead people to God consciousness and obedience to the principles of religion. Sometimes He descends personally, and sometimes He sends His bona fide representative in the form of His son, or servant, or Himself in some disguised form."

                    "commentary": "According to Bhagavad-gita, asadhu(holy man) is a man inKrishnaconsciousness. A person may appear to be irreligious, but if he has the qualifications ofKrishnaconsciousness wholly and fully, he is to be understood to be asadhu. Anddushkritamapplies to those who do not care forKrishnaconsciousness. Such miscreants, ordushkritam, are described as foolish and the lowest of mankind, even though they may be decorated with mundane education, whereas a person who is one hundred percent engaged inKrishnaconsciousness is accepted as asadhu, even though such a person may be neither learned nor well cultured. As far as the atheistic are concerned, it is not necessary for the Supreme Lord to appear as He is to destroy them, as He did with the demonsRavanaandKamsa. The Lord has many agents who are quite competent to vanquish demons. But the Lord especially descends to appease His unalloyed devotees, who are always harassed by the demoniac. The demon harasses the devotee, even though the latter may happen to be his kin. AlthoughPrahladaMaharajawas the son of Hiranyakasipu, he was nonetheless persecuted by his father; althoughDevaki, the mother ofKrishna, was the sister ofKamsa, she and her husbandVasudevawere persecuted only becauseKrishnawas to be born of them. So LordKrishnaappeared primarily to deliverDevaki, rather than killKamsa, but both were performed simultaneously. Therefore it is said here that to deliver the devotee and vanquish the demon miscreants, the Lord appears in different incarnations."

                    "commentary": "The Lord's descent from His transcendental abode is already explained in the 6th verse. One who can understand the truth of the appearance of the Personality of Godhead is already liberated from material bondage, and therefore he returns to the kingdom of God immediately after quitting this present material body. Such liberation of the living entity from material bondage is not at all easy. The impersonalists and the yogis attain liberation only after much trouble and many, many births. Even then, the liberation they achieve -- merging into the impersonal brahmajyoti of the Lord -- is only partial, and there is the risk of returning to this material world. But the devotee, simply by understanding the transcendental nature of the body and activities of the Lord, attains the abode of the Lord after ending this body and does not run the risk of returning to this material world. In theBrahma-samhita(5.33) it is stated that the Lord has many, many forms and incarnations:advaitamacyutamanadimananta-rupam. Although there are many transcendental forms of the Lord, they are still one and the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. One has to understand this fact with conviction, although it is incomprehensible to mundane scholars and empiric philosophers. As stated in the Vedas (Purusha-bodhiniUpanishad):"

                    "commentary": "As described above, it is very difficult for a person who is too materially affected to understand the personal nature of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Generally, people who are attached to the bodily conception of life are so absorbed in materialism that it is almost impossible for them to understand how the Supreme can be a person. Such materialists cannot even imagine that there is a transcendental body which is imperishable, full of knowledge and eternally blissful. In the materialistic concept, the body is perishable, full of ignorance and completely miserable. Therefore, people in general keep this same bodily idea in mind when they are informed of the personal form of the Lord. For such materialistic men, the form of the gigantic material manifestation is supreme. Consequently they consider the Supreme to be impersonal. And because they are too materially absorbed, the conception of retaining the personality after liberation from matter frightens them. When they are informed that spiritual life is also individual and personal, they become afraid of becoming persons again, and so they naturally prefer a kind of merging into the impersonal void. Generally, they compare the living entities to the bubbles of the ocean, which merge into the ocean. That is the highest perfection of spiritual existence attainable without individual personality. This is a kind of fearful stage of life, devoid of perfect knowledge of spiritual existence. Furthermore there are many persons who cannot understand spiritual existence at all. Being embarrassed by so many theories and by contradictions of various types of philosophical speculation, they become disgusted or angry and foolishly conclude that there is no supreme cause and that everything is ultimately void. Such people are in a diseased condition of life. Some people are too materially attached and therefore do not give attention to spiritual life, some of them want to merge into the supreme spiritual cause, and some of them disbelieve in everything, being angry at all sorts of spiritual speculation out of hopelessness. This last class of men take to the shelter of some kind of intoxication, and their affective hallucinations are sometimes accepted as spiritual vision. One has to get rid of all three stages of attachment to the material world: negligence of spiritual life, fear of a spiritual personal identity, and the conception of void that arises from frustration in life. To get free from these three stages of the material concept of life, one has to take complete shelter of the Lord, guided by the bona fide spiritual master, and follow the disciplines and regulative principles of devotional life. The last stage of the devotional life is calledbhava, or transcendental love of Godhead."

ButKrishnais fully realized only by His pure devotees. Consequently,Krishnais the object of everyone's realization, and thus anyone and everyone is satisfied according to one's desire to have Him. In the transcendental world also,Krishnareciprocates with His pure devotees in the transcendental attitude, just as the devotee wants Him. One devotee may wantKrishnaas supreme master, another as his personal friend, another as his son, and still another as his lover.Krishnarewards all the devotees equally, according to their different intensities of love for Him. In the material world, the same reciprocations of feelings are there, and they are equally exchanged by the Lord with the different types of worshipers. The pure devotees both here and in the transcendental abode associate with Him in person and are able to render personal service to the Lord and thus derive transcendental bliss in His loving service. As for those who are impersonalists and who want to commit spiritual suicide by annihilating the individual existence of the living entity,Krishnahelps also by absorbing them into His effulgence. Such impersonalists do not agree to accept the eternal, blissful Personality of Godhead; consequently they cannot relish the bliss of transcendental personal service to the Lord, having extinguished their individuality. Some of them, who are not firmly situated even in the impersonal existence, return to this material field to exhibit their dormant desires for activities. They are not admitted into the spiritual planets, but they are again given a chance to act on the material planets. For those who are fruitive workers, the Lord awards the desired results of their prescribed duties, as the yajnesvara; and those who are yogis seeking mystic powers are awarded such powers. In other words, everyone is dependent for success upon His mercy alone, and all kinds of spiritual processes are but different degrees of success on the same path. Unless, therefore, one comes to the highest perfection ofKrishnaconsciousness, all attempts remain imperfect, as is stated in theSrimad-Bhagavatam(2.3.10):"

Actually, the demigods are not different forms of God, but they are God's different parts and parcels. God is one, and the parts and parcels are many. The Vedas say, nityo nityanam: God is one.Isvarahparamahkrishnah. The Supreme God is one --Krishna-- and the demigods are delegated with powers to manage this material world. These demigods are all living entities (nityanam) with different grades of material power. They cannot be equal to the Supreme God --Narayana,Vishnu, orKrishna. Anyone who thinks that God and the demigods are on the same level is called an atheist, orpashandi. Even the great demigods likeBrahmaandSivacannot be compared to the Supreme Lord. In fact, the Lord is worshiped by demigods such asBrahmaandSiva(siva-virinci-nutam). Yet curiously enough there are many human leaders who are worshiped by foolish men under the misunderstanding of anthropomorphism or zoomorphism.Ihadevatahdenotes a powerful man or demigod of this material world. ButNarayana,Vishnu, orKrishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not belong to this world. He is above, or transcendental to, material creation. EvenSripadaSankaracarya, the leader of the impersonalists, maintains thatNarayana, orKrishna, is beyond this material creation. However, foolish people (hrita-jnana) worship the demigods because they want immediate results. They get the results, but do not know that results so obtained are temporary and are meant for less intelligent persons. The intelligent person is inKrishnaconsciousness, and he has no need to worship the paltry demigods for some immediate, temporary benefit. The demigods of this material world, as well as their worshipers, will vanish with the annihilation of this material world. The boons of the demigods are material and temporary. Both the material worlds and their inhabitants, including the demigods and their worshipers, are bubbles in the cosmic ocean. In this world, however, human society is mad after temporary things such as the material opulence of possessing land, family and enjoyable paraphernalia. To achieve such temporary things, people worship the demigods or powerful men in human society. If a man gets some ministership in the government by worshiping a political leader, he considers that he has achieved a great boon. All of them are therefore kowtowing to the so-called leaders or \"big guns\" in order to achieve temporary boons, and they indeed achieve such things. Such foolish men are not interested inKrishnaconsciousness for the permanent solution to the hardships of material existence. They are all after sense enjoyment, and to get a little facility for sense enjoyment they are attracted to worship empowered living entities known as demigods. This verse indicates that people are rarely interested inKrishnaconsciousness. They are mostly interested in material enjoyment, and therefore they worship some powerful living entity."

He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called brahmanas due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the kshatriyas due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the vaisyas, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the sudras, or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, LordKrishnadoes not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the above-mentioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development ofKrishnaconsciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to the different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person inKrishnaconsciousness, however, is above even the brahmanas. Although brahmanas by quality are supposed to know aboutBrahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, most of them approach only the impersonalBrahmanmanifestation of LordKrishna. But a man who transcends the limited knowledge of abrahmanaand reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, LordSriKrishna, becomes a person inKrishnaconsciousness -- or, in other words, aVaishnava.Krishnaconsciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions ofKrishna, namelyRama,Nrisimha,Varaha, etc. And asKrishnais transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person inKrishnaconsciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species."

The proprietor of an establishment is not responsible for the right and wrong activities of the workers, but the workers are themselves responsible. The living entities are engaged in their respective activities of sense gratification, and these activities are not ordained by the Lord. For advancement of sense gratification, the living entities are engaged in the work of this world, and they aspire to heavenly happiness after death. The Lord, being full in Himself, has no attraction for so-called heavenly happiness. The heavenly demigods are only His engaged servants. The proprietor never desires the low-grade happiness such as the workers may desire. He is aloof from the material actions and reactions. For example, the rains are not responsible for different types of vegetation that appear on the earth, although without such rains there is no possibility of vegetative growth.

                    "commentary": "There are two classes of men. Some of them are full of polluted material things within their hearts, and some of them are materially free.Krishnaconsciousness is equally beneficial for both of these persons. Those who are full of dirty things can take to the line ofKrishnaconsciousness for a gradual cleansing process, following the regulative principles of devotional service. Those who are already cleansed of the impurities may continue to act in the sameKrishnaconsciousness so that others may follow their exemplary activities and thereby be benefited. Foolish persons or neophytes inKrishnaconsciousness often want to retire from activities without having knowledge ofKrishnaconsciousness.Arjuna's desire to retire from activities on the battlefield was not approved by the Lord. One need only know how to act. To retire from the activities ofKrishnaconsciousness and to sit aloof making a show ofKrishnaconsciousness is less important than actually engaging in the field of activities for the sake ofKrishna.Arjunais here advised to act inKrishnaconsciousness, following in the footsteps of the Lord's previous disciples, such as the sun-godVivasvan, as mentioned hereinbefore. The Supreme Lord knows all His past activities, as well as those of persons who acted inKrishnaconsciousness in the past. Therefore He recommends the acts of the sun-god, who learned this art from the Lord some millions of years before. All such students of LordKrishnaare mentioned here as past liberated persons, engaged in the discharge of duties allotted byKrishna."

The entire Bhagavad-gitais directed toward this conclusion. Any other conclusions, against this consciousness and its attendant actions, are vikarmas, or prohibited actions.

                    "commentary": "How activities inKrishnaconsciousness can lead one ultimately to the spiritual goal is described here. There are various activities inKrishnaconsciousness, and all of them will be described in the following verses. But, for the present, just the principle ofKrishnaconsciousness is described. A conditioned soul, entangled in material contamination, is sure to act in the material atmosphere, and yet he has to get out of such an environment. The process by which the conditioned soul can get out of the material atmosphere isKrishnaconsciousness. For example, a patient who is suffering from a disorder of the bowels due to overindulgence in milk products is cured by another milk product, namely curds. The materially absorbed conditioned soul can be cured byKrishnaconsciousness as set forth here in theGita. This process is generally known asyajna, or activities (sacrifices) simply meant for the satisfaction ofVishnu, orKrishna. The more the activities of the material world are performed inKrishnaconsciousness, or forVishnuonly, the more the atmosphere becomes spiritualized by complete absorption. The wordbrahma(Brahman) means \"spiritual.\" The Lord is spiritual, and the rays of His transcendental body are called brahmajyoti, His spiritual effulgence. Everything that exists is situated in that brahmajyoti, but when thejyotiis covered by illusion (maya) or sense gratification, it is called material. This material veil can be removed at once byKrishnaconsciousness; thus the offering for the sake ofKrishnaconsciousness, the consuming agent of such an offering or contribution, the process of consumption, the contributor, and the result are -- all combined together --Brahman, or the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth covered bymayais called matter. Matter dovetailed for the cause of the Absolute Truth regains its spiritual quality.Krishnaconsciousness is the process of converting the illusory consciousness intoBrahman, or the Supreme. When the mind is fully absorbed inKrishnaconsciousness, it is said to be insamadhi, or trance. Anything done in such transcendental consciousness is calledyajna, or sacrifice for the Absolute. In that condition of spiritual consciousness, the contributor, the contribution, the consumption, the performer or leader of the performance, and the result or ultimate gain -- everything -- becomes one in the Absolute, the SupremeBrahman. That is the method ofKrishnaconsciousness."

                    "commentary": "As described above, a person engaged in discharging duties inKrishnaconsciousness is also called a perfectyogior a first-class mystic. But there are others also, who perform similar sacrifices in the worship of demigods, and still others who sacrifice to the SupremeBrahman, or the impersonal feature of the Supreme Lord. So there are different kinds of sacrifices in terms of different categories. Such different categories of sacrifice by different types of performers only superficially demark varieties of sacrifice. Factually sacrifice means to satisfy the Supreme Lord,Vishnu, who is also known asYajna. All the different varieties of sacrifice can be placed within two primary divisions: namely, sacrifice of worldly possessions and sacrifice in pursuit of transcendental knowledge. Those who are inKrishnaconsciousness sacrifice all material possessions for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, while others, who want some temporary material happiness, sacrifice their material possessions to satisfy demigods such asIndra, the sun-god, etc. And others, who are impersonalists, sacrifice their identity by merging into the existence of impersonalBrahman. The demigods are powerful living entities appointed by the Supreme Lord for the maintenance and supervision of all material functions like the heating, watering and lighting of the universe. Those who are interested in material benefits worship the demigods by various sacrifices according to the Vedic rituals. They are called bahv-isvara-vadi, or believers in many gods. But others, who worship the impersonal feature of the Absolute Truth and regard the forms of the demigods as temporary, sacrifice their individual selves in the supreme fire and thus end their individual existences by merging into the existence of the Supreme. Such impersonalists sacrifice their time in philosophical speculation to understand the transcendental nature of the Supreme. In other words, the fruitive workers sacrifice their material possessions for material enjoyment, whereas the impersonalist sacrifices his material designations with a view to merging into the existence of the Supreme. For the impersonalist, the fire altar of sacrifice is the SupremeBrahman, and the offering is the self being consumed by the fire ofBrahman. TheKrishnaconscious person, likeArjuna, however, sacrifices everything for the satisfaction ofKrishna, and thus all his material possessions as well as his own self -- everything -- is sacrificed forKrishna. Thus, he is the first-classyogi; but he does not lose his individual existence."

Since human life is not meant for our enjoying sense gratification like the animals, the four orders of human life are so arranged that one may become perfect in spiritual life. The brahmacaris, or students under the care of a bona fide spiritual master, control the mind by abstaining from sense gratification. Abrahmacarihears only words concerningKrishnaconsciousness; hearing is the basic principle for understanding, and therefore the purebrahmacariengages fully inharernamanukirtanam -- chanting and hearing the glories of the Lord. He restrains himself from the vibrations of material sounds, and his hearing is engaged in the transcendental sound vibration ofHareKrishna,HareKrishna. Similarly, the householders, who have some license for sense gratification, perform such acts with great restraint. Sex life, intoxication and meat-eating are general tendencies of human society, but a regulated householder does not indulge in unrestricted sex life and other sense gratification. Marriage on the principles of religious life is therefore current in all civilized human society because that is the way for restricted sex life. This restricted, unattached sex life is also a kind ofyajnabecause the restricted householder sacrifices his general tendency toward sense gratification for higher, transcendental life."

As long as the soul is attached to sense enjoyment it is called parag-atma, but as soon as the same soul becomes detached from such sense enjoyment it is called pratyag-atma. The soul is subjected to the functions of ten kinds of air at work within the body, and this is perceived through the breathing system. The Patanjali system ofyogainstructs one on how to control the functions of the body's air in a technical manner so that ultimately all the functions of the air within become favorable for purifying the soul of material attachment. According to thisyogasystem, pratyag-atmais the ultimate goal. This pratyag-atmais withdrawn from activities in matter. The senses interact with the sense objects, like the ear for hearing, eyes for seeing, nose for smelling, tongue for tasting, hand for touching, and all of them are thus engaged in activities outside the self. They are called the functions of theprana-vayu. Theapana-vayugoes downwards, vyana-vayuacts to shrink and expand,samana-vayuadjusts equilibrium,udana-vayugoes upwards -- and when one is enlightened, one engages all these in searching for self-realization."

                    "commentary": "These sacrifices may be fitted into various divisions. There are persons who are sacrificing their possessions in the form of various kinds of charities. In India, the rich mercantile community or princely orders open various kinds of charitable institutions likedharma-sala,anna-kshetra,atithi-sala, anathalaya andvidya-pitha. In other countries, too, there are many hospitals, old age homes and similar charitable foundations meant for distributing food, education and medical treatment free to the poor. All these charitable activities are called dravyamaya-yajna. There are others who, for higher elevation in life or for promotion to higher planets within the universe, voluntarily accept many kinds of austerities such as candrayana andcaturmasya. These processes entail severe vows for conducting life under certain rigid rules. For example, under thecaturmasyavow the candidate does not shave for four months during the year (July to October), he does not eat certain foods, does not eat twice in a day or does not leave home. Such sacrifice of the comforts of life is called tapomaya-yajna. There are still others who engage themselves in different kinds of mystic yogas like the Patanjali system (for merging into the existence of the Absolute), orhatha-yogaor ashtanga-yoga(for particular perfections). And some travel to all the sanctified places of pilgrimage. All these practices are calledyoga-yajna, sacrifice for a certain type of perfection in the material world. There are others who engage themselves in the studies of different Vedic literatures, specifically the Upanishads andVedanta-sutras, or theSankhyaphilosophy. All of these are calledsvadhyaya-yajna. or engagement in the sacrifice of studies. All these yogis are faithfully engaged in different types of sacrifice and are seeking a higher status of life.Krishnaconsciousness, however, is different from these because it is the direct service of the Supreme Lord.Krishnaconsciousness cannot be attained by any one of the above-mentioned types of sacrifice but can be attained only by the mercy of the Lord and His bona fide devotees. Therefore,Krishnaconsciousness is transcendental."

In other words, existence in the material world is due to the multiple reactions to our sinful lives. Ignorance is the cause of sinful life, and sinful life is the cause of one's dragging on in material existence. The human form of life is the only loophole by which one may get out of this entanglement. The Vedas, therefore, give us a chance for escape by pointing out the paths of religion, economic comfort, regulated sense gratification and, at last, the means to get out of the miserable condition entirely. The path of religion, or the different kinds of sacrifice recommended above, automatically solves our economic problems. By performance ofyajnawe can have enough food, enough milk, etc. -- even if there is a so-called increase of population. When the body is fully supplied, naturally the next stage is to satisfy the senses. The Vedas prescribe, therefore, sacred marriage for regulated sense gratification. Thereby one is gradually elevated to the platform of release from material bondage, and the highest perfection of liberated life is to associate with the Supreme Lord. Perfection is achieved by performance ofyajna(sacrifice), as described above. Now, if a person is not inclined to performyajnaaccording to the Vedas, how can he expect a happy life even in this body, and what to speak of another body on another planet? There are different grades of material comforts in different heavenly planets, and in all cases there is immense happiness for persons engaged in different kinds ofyajna. But the highest kind of happiness that a man can achieve is to be promoted to the spiritual planets by practice ofKrishnaconsciousness. A life ofKrishnaconsciousness is therefore the solution to all the problems of material existence."

Nonetheless, there is a mystery about all these different activities of sacrifice, and one should know this mystery. Sacrifices sometimes take different forms according to the particular faith of the performer. When one's faith reaches the stage of transcendental knowledge, the performer of sacrifices should be considered more advanced than those who simply sacrifice material possessions without such knowledge, for without attainment of knowledge, sacrifices remain on the material platform and bestow no spiritual benefit. Real knowledge culminates inKrishnaconsciousness, the highest stage of transcendental knowledge. Without the elevation of knowledge, sacrifices are simply material activities. When, however, they are elevated to the level of transcendental knowledge, all such activities enter onto the spiritual platform. Depending on differences in consciousness, sacrificial activities are sometimes calledkarma-kanda(fruitive activities) and sometimesjnana-kanda(knowledge in the pursuit of truth).

Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help lead one to the right path. Nor by independent study of books of knowledge can one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. Not only should one hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect."

The sense of an existence separate fromKrishnais calledmaya(ma-- not,ya-- this). Some think that we have nothing to do withKrishna, thatKrishnais only a great historical personality and that the Absolute is the impersonalBrahman. Factually, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, this impersonalBrahmanis the personal effulgence ofKrishna.Krishna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the cause of everything. In theBrahma-samhitait is clearly stated thatKrishnais the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes. Even the millions of incarnations are only His different expansions. Similarly, the living entities are also expansions ofKrishna. TheMayavadiphilosophers wrongly think thatKrishnaloses His own separate existence in His many expansions. This thought is material in nature. We have experience in the material world that a thing, when fragmentally distributed, loses its own original identity. But theMayavadiphilosophers fail to understand that absolute means that one plus one is equal to one, and that one minus one is also equal to one. This is the case in the absolute world."

                    "commentary": "Theyogasystem instructed in this chapter is calledsanatana-yoga, or eternal activities performed by the living entity. Thisyogahas two divisions of sacrificial actions: one is called sacrifice of one's material possessions, and the other is called knowledge of self, which is pure spiritual activity. If sacrifice of one's material possessions is not dovetailed for spiritual realization, then such sacrifice becomes material. But one who performs such sacrifices with a spiritual objective, or in devotional service, makes a perfect sacrifice. When we come to spiritual activities, we find that these are also divided into two: namely, understanding of one's own self (or one's constitutional position), and the truth regarding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who follows the path of Bhagavad-gitaas it is can very easily understand these two important divisions of spiritual knowledge. For him there is no difficulty in obtaining perfect knowledge of the self as part and parcel of the Lord. And such understanding is beneficial, for such a person can easily understand the transcendental activities of the Lord. In the beginning of this chapter, the transcendental activities of the Lord were discussed by the Supreme Lord Himself. One who does not understand the instructions of theGitais faithless, and is to be considered to be misusing the fragmental independence awarded to him by the Lord. In spite of such instructions, one who does not understand the real nature of the Lord as the eternal, blissful, all-knowing Personality of Godhead is certainly fool number one. Ignorance can be removed by gradual acceptance of the principles ofKrishnaconsciousness.Krishnaconsciousness is awakened by different types of sacrifices to the demigods, sacrifice toBrahman, sacrifice in celibacy, in household life, in controlling the senses, in practicing mysticyoga, in penance, in forgoing material possessions, in studying the Vedas, and in partaking of the social institution calledvarnasrama-dharma. All of these are known as sacrifice, and all of them are based on regulated action. But within all these activities, the important factor is self-realization. One who seeks that objective is the real student of Bhagavad-gita, but one who doubts the authority ofKrishnafalls back. One is therefore advised to study Bhagavad-gita, or any other scripture, under a bona fide spiritual master, with service and surrender. A bona fide spiritual master is in the disciplic succession from time eternal, and he does not deviate at all from the instructions of the Supreme Lord as they were imparted millions of years ago to the sun-god, from whom the instructions of Bhagavad-gitahave come down to the earthly kingdom. One should, therefore, follow the path of Bhagavad-gitaas it is expressed in theGitaitself and beware of self-interested people after personal aggrandizement who deviate others from the actual path. The Lord is definitely the supreme person, and His activities are transcendental. One who understands this is a liberated person from the very beginning of his study of Bhagavad-gita."

                    "commentary": "In this Fifth Chapter of the Bhagavad-gita, the Lord says that work in devotional service is better than dry mental speculation. Devotional service is easier than the latter because, being transcendental in nature, it frees one from reaction. In the Second Chapter, preliminary knowledge of the soul and its entanglement in the material body were explained. How to get out of this material encagement bybuddhi-yoga, or devotional service, was also explained therein. In the Third Chapter, it was explained that a person who is situated on the platform of knowledge no longer has any duties to perform. And in the Fourth Chapter the Lord toldArjunathat all kinds of sacrificial work culminate in knowledge. However, at the end of the Fourth Chapter, the Lord advisedArjunato wake up and fight, being situated in perfect knowledge. Therefore, by simultaneously stressing the importance of both work in devotion and inaction in knowledge,Krishnahas perplexedArjunaand confused his determination.Arjunaunderstands that renunciation in knowledge involves cessation of all kinds of work performed as sense activities. But if one performs work in devotional service, then how is work stopped? In other words, he thinks thatsannyasa, or renunciation in knowledge, should be altogether free from all kinds of activity, because work and renunciation appear to him to be incompatible. He appears not to have understood that work in full knowledge is nonreactive and is therefore the same as inaction. He inquires, therefore, whether he should cease work altogether or work with full knowledge."

Such a renouncer, dedicated to the transcendental loving service of the Lord, is fully qualified in knowledge because he knows his constitutional position in his relationship withKrishna. He knows fully well thatKrishnais the whole and that he is part and parcel ofKrishna. Such knowledge is perfect because it is qualitatively and quantitatively correct. The concept of oneness withKrishnais incorrect because the part cannot be equal to the whole. Knowledge that one is one in quality yet different in quantity is correct transcendental knowledge leading one to become full in himself, having nothing to aspire to or lament over. There is no duality in his mind because whatever he does, he does forKrishna. Being thus freed from the platform of dualities, he is liberated -- even in this material world."

                    "commentary": "The real purpose of philosophical research is to find the ultimate goal of life. Since the ultimate goal of life is self-realization, there is no difference between the conclusions reached by the two processes. BySankhyaphilosophical research one comes to the conclusion that a living entity is not a part and parcel of the material world but of the supreme spirit whole. Consequently, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material world; his actions must be in some relation with the Supreme. When he acts inKrishnaconsciousness, he is actually in his constitutional position. In the first process,Sankhya, one has to become detached from matter, and in the devotionalyogaprocess one has to attach himself to the work ofKrishnaconsciousness. Factually, both processes are the same, although superficially one process appears to involve detachment and the other process appears to involve attachment. Detachment from matter and attachment toKrishnaare one and the same. One who can see this sees things as they are."

                    "commentary": "There are two classes of sannyasis, or persons in the renounced order of life. TheMayavadisannyasis are engaged in the study ofSankhyaphilosophy, whereas theVaishnavasannyasis are engaged in the study ofBhagavatamphilosophy, which affords the proper commentary on theVedanta-sutras. TheMayavadisannyasis also study theVedanta-sutras, but use their own commentary, calledSariraka-bhashya, written bySankaracarya. The students of theBhagavataschool are engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, according to pancaratriki regulations, and therefore theVaishnavasannyasis have multiple engagements in the transcendental service of the Lord. TheVaishnavasannyasis have nothing to do with material activities, and yet they perform various activities in their devotional service to the Lord. But theMayavadisannyasis, engaged in the studies ofSankhyaandVedantaand speculation, cannot relish the transcendental service of the Lord. Because their studies become very tedious, they sometimes become tired ofBrahmanspeculation, and thus they take shelter of theBhagavatamwithout proper understanding. Consequently their study of theSrimad-Bhagavatambecomes troublesome. Dry speculations and impersonal interpretations by artificial means are all useless for theMayavadisannyasis. TheVaishnavasannyasis, who are engaged in devotional service, are happy in the discharge of their transcendental duties, and they have the guarantee of ultimate entrance into the kingdom of God. TheMayavadisannyasis sometimes fall down from the path of self-realization and again enter into material activities of a philanthropic and altruistic nature, which are nothing but material engagements. Therefore, the conclusion is that those who are engaged inKrishnaconscious activities are better situated than the sannyasis engaged in simple speculation about what isBrahmanand what is notBrahman, although they too come toKrishnaconsciousness, after many births."

This is due to hisKrishnaconsciousness. Such a person cannot think of any living being as separate fromKrishna, just as the leaves and branches of a tree are not separate from the tree. He knows very well that by pouring water on the root of the tree, the water will be distributed to all the leaves and branches, or by supplying food to the stomach, the energy is automatically distributed throughout the body. Because one who works inKrishnaconsciousness is servant to all, he is very dear to everyone. And because everyone is satisfied by his work, he is pure in consciousness. Because he is pure in consciousness, his mind is completely controlled. And because his mind is controlled, his senses are also controlled. Because his mind is always fixed onKrishna, there is no chance of his being deviated fromKrishna. Nor is there a chance that he will engage his senses in matters other than the service of the Lord. He does not like to hear anything except topics relating toKrishna; he does not like to eat anything which is not offered toKrishna; and he does not wish to go anywhere ifKrishnais not involved. Therefore, his senses are controlled. A man of controlled senses cannot be offensive to anyone. One may ask, \"Why then wasArjunaoffensive (in battle) to others? Wasn't he inKrishnaconsciousness?\"Arjunawas only superficially offensive because (as has already been explained in the Second Chapter) all the assembled persons on the battlefield would continue to live individually, as the soul cannot be slain. So, spiritually, no one was killed on the Battlefield ofKurukshetra. Only their dresses were changed by the order ofKrishna, who was personally present. ThereforeArjuna, while fighting on the Battlefield ofKurukshetra, was not really fighting at all; he was simply carrying out the orders ofKrishnain fullKrishnaconsciousness. Such a person is never entangled in the reactions of work."

The Vedic hymnssarvamhy etadbrahma(MandukyaUpanishad2), tasmad etadbrahmanama-rupamannamcajayate(MundakaUpanishad1.2.10), and, in the Bhagavad-gita(14.3),mamayonir mahadbrahmaindicate that everything in the material world is a manifestation ofBrahman; and although the effects are differently manifested, they are nondifferent from the cause. In the Isopanishad it is said that everything is related to the SupremeBrahman, orKrishna, and thus everything belongs to Him only. One who knows perfectly well that everything belongs toKrishna, that He is the proprietor of everything and that, therefore, everything is engaged in the service of the Lord, naturally has nothing to do with the results of his activities, whether virtuous or sinful. Even one's material body, being a gift of the Lord for carrying out a particular type of action, can be engaged inKrishnaconsciousness. It is then beyond contamination by sinful reactions, exactly as the lotus leaf, though remaining in the water, is not wet. The Lord also says in theGita(3.30),mayisarvanikarmanisannyasya: \"Resign all works unto Me [Krishna].\" The conclusion is that a person withoutKrishnaconsciousness acts according to the concept of the material body and senses, but a person inKrishnaconsciousness acts according to the knowledge that the body is the property ofKrishnaand should therefore be engaged in the service ofKrishna."

InKrishnaconsciousness, there is no duality. All that exists is a product ofKrishna's energy, andKrishnais all good.

Somehow the superior nature, the living entity, has been in contact with material nature since time immemorial. The temporary body or material dwelling place which he obtains is the cause of varieties of activities and their resultant reactions. Living in such a conditional atmosphere, one suffers the results of the activities of the body by identifying himself (in ignorance) with the body. It is ignorance acquired from time immemorial that is the cause of bodily suffering and distress. As soon as the living entity becomes aloof from the activities of the body, he becomes free from the reactions as well. As long as he is in the city of body, he appears to be the master of it, but actually he is neither its proprietor nor controller of its actions and reactions. He is simply in the midst of the material ocean, struggling for existence. The waves of the ocean are tossing him, and he has no control over them. His best solution is to get out of the water by transcendentalKrishnaconsciousness. That alone will save him from all turmoil."

                    "commentary": "The Sanskrit wordvibhumeans the Supreme Lord who is full of unlimited knowledge, riches, strength, fame, beauty and renunciation. He is always satisfied in Himself, undisturbed by sinful or pious activities. He does not create a particular situation for any living entity, but the living entity, bewildered by ignorance, desires to be put into certain conditions of life, and thereby his chain of action and reaction begins. A living entity is, by superior nature, full of knowledge. Nevertheless, he is prone to be influenced by ignorance due to his limited power. The Lord is omnipotent, but the living entity is not. The Lord isvibhu, or omniscient, but the living entity isanu, or atomic. Because he is a living soul, he has the capacity to desire by his free will. Such desire is fulfilled only by the omnipotent Lord. And so, when the living entity is bewildered in his desires, the Lord allows him to fulfill those desires, but the Lord is never responsible for the actions and reactions of the particular situation which may be desired. Being in a bewildered condition, therefore, the embodied soul identifies himself with the circumstantial material body and becomes subjected to the temporary misery and happiness of life. The Lord is the constant companion of the living entity asParamatma, or the Supersoul, and therefore He can understand the desires of the individual soul, as one can smell the flavor of a flower by being near it. Desire is a subtle form of conditioning for the living entity. The Lord fulfills his desire as he deserves: Man proposes and God disposes. The individual is not, therefore, omnipotent in fulfilling his desires. The Lord, however, can fulfill all desires, and the Lord, being neutral to everyone, does not interfere with the desires of the minute independent living entities. However, when one desiresKrishna, the Lord takes special care and encourages one to desire in such a way that one can attain to Him and be eternally happy. The Vedic hymns therefore declare,eshauhyevasadhukarmakarayatitamyamebhyo lokebhya unninishate.eshauevasadhukarmakarayatiyamadhoninishate: \"The Lord engages the living entity in pious activities so that he may be elevated. The Lord engages him in impious activities so that he may go to hell.\" (KaushitakiUpanishad3.8)"

                    "commentary": "Those who have forgottenKrishnamust certainly be bewildered, but those who are inKrishnaconsciousness are not bewildered at all. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gita,sarvamjnana-plavena, jnanagnihsarva-karmaniandnahijnanenasadrisam. Knowledge is always highly esteemed. And what is that knowledge? Perfect knowledge is achieved when one surrenders untoKrishna, as is said in the Seventh Chapter, 19th verse:bahunamjanmanamantejnanavanmamprapadyate. After passing through many, many births, when one perfect in knowledge surrenders untoKrishna, or when one attainsKrishnaconsciousness, then everything is revealed to him, as everything is revealed by the sun in the daytime. The living entity is bewildered in so many ways. For instance, when he unceremoniously thinks himself God, he actually falls into the last snare of nescience. If a living entity is God, then how can he become bewildered by nescience? Does God become bewildered by nescience? If so, then nescience, or Satan, is greater than God. Real knowledge can be obtained from a person who is in perfectKrishnaconsciousness. Therefore, one has to seek out such a bona fide spiritual master and, under him, learn whatKrishnaconsciousness is, forKrishnaconsciousness will certainly drive away all nescience, as the sun drives away darkness. Even though a person may be in full knowledge that he is not this body but is transcendental to the body, he still may not be able to discriminate between the soul and the Supersoul. However, he can know everything well if he cares to take shelter of the perfect, bona fideKrishnaconscious spiritual master. One can know God and one's relationship with God only when one actually meets a representative of God. A representative of God never claims that he is God, although he is paid all the respect ordinarily paid to God because he has knowledge of God. One has to learn the distinction between God and the living entity. LordSriKrishnatherefore stated in the Second Chapter (2.12) that every living being is individual and that the Lord also is individual. They were all individuals in the past, they are individuals at present, and they will continue to be individuals in the future, even after liberation. At night we see everything as one in the darkness, but in day, when the sun is up, we see everything in its real identity. Identity with individuality in spiritual life is real knowledge."

Thebrahmanaand the outcaste may be different from the social point of view, or a dog, a cow, and an elephant may be different from the point of view of species, but these differences of body are meaningless from the viewpoint of a learned transcendentalist. This is due to their relationship to the Supreme, for the Supreme Lord, by His plenary portion asParamatma, is present in everyone's heart. Such an understanding of the Supreme is real knowledge. As far as the bodies are concerned in different castes or different species of life, the Lord is equally kind to everyone because He treats every living being as a friend yet maintains Himself asParamatmaregardless of the circumstances of the living entities. The Lord asParamatmais present both in the outcaste and in thebrahmana, although the body of abrahmanaand that of an outcaste are not the same. The bodies are material productions of different modes of material nature, but the soul and the Supersoul within the body are of the same spiritual quality. The similarity in the quality of the soul and the Supersoul, however, does not make them equal in quantity, for the individual soul is present only in that particular body whereas theParamatmais present in each and every body. AKrishnaconscious person has full knowledge of this, and therefore he is truly learned and has equal vision. The similar characteristics of the soul and Supersoul are that they are both conscious, eternal and blissful. But the difference is that the individual soul is conscious within the limited jurisdiction of the body whereas the Supersoul is conscious of all bodies. The Supersoul is present in all bodies without distinction."

But they do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the Bhagavad-gita. The greatest peace formula is simply this: LordKrishnais the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, LordSivaand LordBrahma. In the Vedas (SvetasvataraUpanishad6.7) the Supreme Lord is described astamisvaranamparamammahesvaram. Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey, but actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature. Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world either individually or collectively. This is the sense ofKrishnaconsciousness: LordKrishnais the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in completeKrishnaconsciousness."

However, this is very difficult for people in general to perform, especially in the Age ofKali. Although the eightfoldyogasystem is recommended in this chapter, the Lord emphasizes that the process ofkarma-yoga, or acting inKrishnaconsciousness, is better. Everyone acts in this world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia, but no one is working without some self-interest, some personal gratification, be it concentrated or extended. The criterion of perfection is to act inKrishnaconsciousness, and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work. To act inKrishnaconsciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and parcels of the Supreme. The parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body. The limbs of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole. Similarly, the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction is the perfectsannyasi, the perfectyogi."

                    "commentary": "Realsannyasa-yogaorbhaktimeans that one should know his constitutional position as the living entity, and act accordingly. The living entity has no separate independent identity. He is the marginal energy of the Supreme. When he is entrapped by material energy, he is conditioned, and when he isKrishnaconscious, or aware of the spiritual energy, then he is in his real and natural state of life. Therefore, when one is in complete knowledge, one ceases all material sense gratification, or renounces all kinds of sense gratificatory activities. This is practiced by the yogis who restrain the senses from material attachment. But a person inKrishnaconsciousness has no opportunity to engage his senses in anything which is not for the purpose ofKrishna. Therefore, aKrishnaconscious person is simultaneously asannyasiand ayogi. The purpose of knowledge and of restraining the senses, as prescribed in thejnanaandyogaprocesses, is automatically served inKrishnaconsciousness. If one is unable to give up the activities of his selfish nature, thenjnanaandyogaare of no avail. The real aim is for a living entity to give up all selfish satisfaction and to be prepared to satisfy the Supreme. AKrishnaconscious person has no desire for any kind of self-enjoyment. He is always engaged for the enjoyment of the Supreme. One who has no information of the Supreme must therefore be engaged in self-satisfaction, because no one can stand on the platform of inactivity. All purposes are perfectly served by the practice ofKrishnaconsciousness."

In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses. In fact, the pure soul is entangled in the material world because the mind is involved with the false ego, which desires to lord it over material nature. Therefore, the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature, and in this way the conditioned soul may be saved. One should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects. The more one is attracted by sense objects, the more one becomes entangled in material existence.

One who cannot control his mind lives always with the greatest enemy, and thus his life and its mission are spoiled. The constitutional position of the living entity is to carry out the order of the superior. As long as one's mind remains an unconquered enemy, one has to serve the dictations of lust, anger, avarice, illusion, etc. But when the mind is conquered, one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of the Personality of Godhead, who is situated within the heart of everyone asParamatma.

                    "commentary": "Actually, every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated in everyone's heart asParamatma. When the mind is misled by the external, illusory energy, one becomes entangled in material activities. Therefore, as soon as one's mind is controlled through one of theyogasystems, one should be considered to have already reached the destination. One has to abide by superior dictation. When one's mind is fixed on the superior nature, he has no alternative but to follow the dictation of the Supreme. The mind must admit some superior dictation and follow it. The effect of controlling the mind is that one automatically follows the dictation of theParamatma, or Supersoul. Because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is inKrishnaconsciousness, the devotee of the Lord is unaffected by the dualities of material existence, namely distress and happiness, cold and heat, etc. This state is practicalsamadhi, or absorption in the Supreme."

                    "commentary": "\"Sacred place\" refers to places of pilgrimage.

But often this is not possible, especially for Westerners. The so-calledyogasocieties in big cities may be successful in earning material benefit, but they are not at all suitable for the actual practice ofyoga. One who is not self-controlled and whose mind is not undisturbed cannot practice meditation. Therefore, in the Brihan-naradiyaPuranait is said that inKali-yuga(the presentyuga, or age), when people in general are short-lived, slow in spiritual realization and always disturbed by various anxieties, the best means of spiritual realization is chanting the holy name of the Lord."

There is no need for men to eat animals, because there is an ample supply of grains, vegetables, fruits and milk. Such simple foodstuff is considered to be in the mode of goodness according to the Bhagavad-gita. Animal food is for those in the mode of ignorance. Therefore, those who indulge in animal food, drinking, smoking and eating food which is not first offered toKrishnawill suffer sinful reactions because of eating only polluted things.Bhunjatetetvaghampapayepacantyatma-karanat. Anyone who eats for sense pleasure, or cooks for himself, not offering his food toKrishna, eats only sin. One who eats sin and eats more than is allotted to him cannot execute perfectyoga. It is best that one eat only the remnants of foodstuff offered toKrishna. A person inKrishnaconsciousness does not eat anything which is not first offered toKrishna. Therefore, only theKrishnaconscious person can attain perfection inyogapractice. Nor can one who artificially abstains from eating, manufacturing his own personal process of fasting, practiceyoga. TheKrishnaconscious person observes fasting as it is recommended in the scriptures. He does not fast or eat more than is required, and he is thus competent to performyogapractice. One who eats more than required will dream very much while sleeping, and he must consequently sleep more than is required. One should not sleep more than six hours daily. One who sleeps more than six hours out of twenty-four is certainly influenced by the mode of ignorance. A person in the mode of ignorance is lazy and prone to sleep a great deal.

As far as eating is concerned, it can be regulated only when one is practiced to take and acceptprasadam, sanctified food. LordKrishnais offered, according to the Bhagavad-gita(9.26), vegetables, flowers, fruits, grains, milk, etc. In this way, a person inKrishnaconsciousness becomes automatically trained not to accept food not meant for human consumption, or not in the category of goodness. As far as sleeping is concerned, aKrishnaconscious person is always alert in the discharge of his duties inKrishnaconsciousness, and therefore any unnecessary time spent sleeping is considered a great loss.Avyartha-kalatvam: [Cc.Madhya23.18-19] aKrishnaconscious person cannot bear to pass a minute of his life without being engaged in the service of the Lord. Therefore, his sleeping is kept to a minimum. His ideal in this respect isSrilaRupaGosvami, who was always engaged in the service ofKrishnaand who could not sleep more than two hours a day, and sometimes not even that.ThakuraHaridasawould not even acceptprasadamnor even sleep for a moment without finishing his daily routine of chanting with his beads three hundred thousand names. As far as work is concerned, aKrishnaconscious person does not do anything which is not connected withKrishna's interest, and thus his work is always regulated and is untainted by sense gratification. Since there is no question of sense gratification, there is no material leisure for a person inKrishnaconsciousness. And because he is regulated in all his work, speech, sleep, wakefulness and all other bodily activities, there is no material misery for him."

And after this, one becomes situated in trance, orsamadhi, which means that theyogirealizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself.Yogapractice is more or less based on the principles of the Patanjali system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the Patanjali system ofyoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the Patanjali system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure, out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the nondualist, but in this verse transcendental pleasure -- realized through transcendental senses -- is accepted. And this is corroborated by PatanjaliMuni, the famous exponent of theyogasystem. The great sage declares in hisYoga-sutras (3.34):purushartha-sunyanamgunanampratiprasavahkaivalyamsvarupa-pratishthavaciti-saktiriti."

And because one inKrishnaconsciousness is happy, he tries to distribute the knowledge ofKrishnaeverywhere.

It is not possible for an ordinary man to leave home and go to a secluded place in the mountains or jungles to practiceyogain this Age ofKali. The present age is characterized by a bitter struggle for a life of short duration. People are not serious about self-realization even by simple, practical means, and what to speak of this difficultyogasystem, which regulates the mode of living, the manner of sitting, selection of place, and detachment of the mind from material engagements. As a practical man,Arjunathought it was impossible to follow this system ofyoga, even though he was favorably endowed in many ways. He belonged to the royal family and was highly elevated in terms of numerous qualities; he was a great warrior, he had great longevity, and, above all, he was the most intimate friend of LordKrishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Five thousand years ago,Arjunahad much better facilities than we do now, yet he refused to accept this system ofyoga. In fact, we do not find any record in history of his practicing it at any time. Therefore this system must be considered generally impossible in this Age ofKali. Of course it may be possible for some very few, rare men, but for the people in general it is an impossible proposal. If this were so five thousand years ago, then what of the present day? Those who are imitating thisyogasystem in different so-called schools and societies, although complacent, are certainly wasting their time. They are completely in ignorance of the desired goal."

                    "commentary": "The difficulty of controlling the obstinate mind, as expressed byArjuna, is accepted by the Personality of Godhead. But at the same time He suggests that by practice and detachment it is possible. What is that practice? In the present age no one can observe the strict rules and regulations of placing oneself in a sacred place, focusing the mind on the Supersoul, restraining the senses and mind, observing celibacy, remaining alone, etc. By the practice ofKrishnaconsciousness, however, one engages in nine types of devotional service to the Lord. The first and foremost of such devotional engagements is hearing aboutKrishna. This is a very powerful transcendental method for purging the mind of all misgivings. The more one hears aboutKrishna, the more one becomes enlightened and detached from everything that draws the mind away fromKrishna. By detaching the mind from activities not devoted to the Lord, one can very easily learnvairagya.Vairagyameans detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit. Impersonal spiritual detachment is more difficult than attaching the mind to the activities ofKrishna. This is practical because by hearing aboutKrishnaone becomes automatically attached to the Supreme Spirit. This attachment is called paresanubhava, spiritual satisfaction. It is just like the feeling of satisfaction a hungry man has for every morsel of food he eats. The more one eats while hungry, the more one feels satisfaction and strength. Similarly, by discharge of devotional service one feels transcendental satisfaction as the mind becomes detached from material objectives. It is something like curing a disease by expert treatment and appropriate diet. Hearing of the transcendental activities of LordKrishnais therefore expert treatment for the mad mind, and eating the foodstuff offered toKrishnais the appropriate diet for the suffering patient. This treatment is the process ofKrishnaconsciousness."

Trying to practiceyogawhile engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it.Yogapractice without mental control is a waste of time. Such a show ofyogamay be materially lucrative, but it is useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned.

                    "commentary": "The path of self-realization or mysticism is described in the Bhagavad-gita. The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and that his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge. These are transcendental, beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, by the practice of the eightfold system or bybhakti-yoga. In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God, and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage ofKrishnaconsciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter: even a little endeavor on the transcendental path offers a great hope for deliverance. Out of these three methods, the path ofbhakti-yogais especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God realization. To be doubly assured,Arjunais asking LordKrishnato confirm His former statement. One may sincerely accept the path of self-realization, but the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of the eightfoldyogasystem are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore, despite constant endeavor one may fail, for many reasons. First of all, one may not be sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy. Consequently, whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy, and there is every chance of being allured again, even while performing transcendental disciplines. This is called yogaccalita-manasah: deviation from the transcendental path.Arjunais inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization."

                    "commentary": "There are two ways to progress. Those who are materialists have no interest in transcendence; therefore they are more interested in material advancement by economic development, or in promotion to the higher planets by appropriate work. When one takes to the path of transcendence, one has to cease all material activities and sacrifice all forms of so-called material happiness. If the aspiring transcendentalist fails, then he apparently loses both ways; in other words, he can enjoy neither material happiness nor spiritual success. He has no position; he is like a riven cloud. A cloud in the sky sometimes deviates from a small cloud and joins a big one. But if it cannot join a big one, then it is blown away by the wind and becomes a nonentity in the vast sky. Thebrahmanahpathiis the path of transcendental realization through knowing oneself to be spiritual in essence, part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, who is manifested asBrahman,ParamatmaandBhagavan. LordSriKrishnais the fullest manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, and therefore one who is surrendered to the Supreme Person is a successful transcendentalist. To reach this goal of life throughBrahmanandParamatmarealization takes many, many births (bahunamjanmanamante[Bg. 7.19]). Therefore the supermost path of transcendental realization isbhakti-yoga, orKrishnaconsciousness, the direct method."

So He has already cleared up the question of the future of the individual living entity. Now,Arjunawants to know of the future of the unsuccessful transcendentalist. No one is equal to or aboveKrishna, and certainly the so-called great sages and philosophers who are at the mercy of material nature cannot equal Him.

KingBharatawas the emperor of the world, and since his time this planet has been known among the demigods asBharata-varsha. Formerly it was known asIlavrita-varsha. The emperor, at an early age, retired for spiritual perfection but failed to achieve success. In his next life he took birth in the family of a goodbrahmanaand was known asJadaBharatabecause he always remained secluded and did not talk to anyone. And later on he was discovered as the greatest transcendentalist by KingRahugana. From his life it is understood that transcendental endeavors, or the practice ofyoga, never go in vain. By the grace of the Lord the transcendentalist gets repeated opportunities for complete perfection inKrishnaconsciousness."

The Lord has confirmed herein the superiority ofyoga, but He has not mentioned that it is better thanbhakti-yoga.Bhakti-yogais full spiritual knowledge, and therefore nothing can excel it. Asceticism without self-knowledge is imperfect. Empiric knowledge without surrender to the Supreme Lord is also imperfect. And fruitive work withoutKrishnaconsciousness is a waste of time. Therefore, the most highly praised form ofyogaperformance mentioned here isbhakti-yoga, and this is still more clearly explained in the next verse."

But service with love and faith is especially meant for the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

However,Krishnacan be known only by persons who are inKrishnaconsciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonalBrahmanrealization, for this is easier than understandingKrishna.Krishnais the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge ofBrahmanandParamatma.

Spirit is not created at a certain stage of material development. Rather, this material world is manifested only on the basis of spiritual energy. This material body is developed because spirit is present within matter; a child grows gradually to boyhood and then to manhood because that superior energy, spirit soul, is present. Similarly, the entire cosmic manifestation of the gigantic universe is developed because of the presence of the Supersoul,Vishnu. Therefore spirit and matter, which combine to manifest this gigantic universal form, are originally two energies of the Lord, and consequently the Lord is the original cause of everything. A fragmental part and parcel of the Lord, namely the living entity, may be the cause of a big skyscraper, a big factory, or even a big city, but he cannot be the cause of a big universe. The cause of the big universe is the big soul, or the Supersoul. AndKrishna, the Supreme, is the cause of both the big and small souls. Therefore He is the original cause of all causes.

That the Personality of Godhead is the Supreme Absolute Truth is also the affirmation of theBrahma-samhita:isvarahparamahkrishnahsac-cid-ananda-vigrahah; that is, the Supreme Absolute Truth Personality of Godhead is LordKrishna, who is the primeval Lord, the reservoir of all pleasure,Govinda, and the eternal form of complete bliss and knowledge. These authorities leave no doubt that the Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. The impersonalist, however, argues on the strength of the Vedic version given in the SvetasvataraUpanishad(3.10): tatoyaduttarataramtadarupamanamayam/yaetad vidur amritastebhavantiathetareduhkhamevapiyanti. \"In the material worldBrahma, the primeval living entity within the universe, is understood to be the supreme amongst the demigods, human beings and lower animals.

                    "commentary": "This verse explains how the Lord is all-pervasive by His diverse material and spiritual energies. The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, so the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water, because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying tasty water to quench man's thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore LordCaitanyaestablished His sublime doctrine:acintyabheda-and-abheda-tattva-- simultaneous oneness and difference."

Similarly, everything has a particular original taste, and this taste can be changed by the mixture of chemicals. So everything original has some smell, some fragrance, and some taste.Vibhavasumeans fire. Without fire we cannot run factories, we cannot cook, etc., and that fire isKrishna. The heat in the fire isKrishna. According to Vedic medicine, indigestion is due to a low temperature in the belly. So even for digestion fire is needed. InKrishnaconsciousness we become aware that earth, water, fire, air and every active principle, all chemicals and all material elements are due toKrishna. The duration of man's life is also due toKrishna. Therefore by the grace ofKrishna, man can prolong his life or diminish it. SoKrishnaconsciousness is active in every sphere."

                    "commentary": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead has innumerable energies, and all these energies are divine. Although the living entities are part of His energies and are therefore divine, due to contact with material energy their original superior power is covered. Being thus covered by material energy, one cannot possibly overcome its influence. As previously stated, both the material and spiritual natures, being emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are eternal. The living entities belong to the eternal superior nature of the Lord, but due to contamination by the inferior nature, matter, their illusion is also eternal. The conditioned soul is therefore callednitya-baddha, or eternally conditioned. No one can trace out the history of his becoming conditioned at a certain date in material history. Consequently, his release from the clutches of material nature is very difficult, even though that material nature is an inferior energy, because material energy is ultimately conducted by the supreme will, which the living entity cannot overcome. Inferior, material nature is defined herein as divine nature due to its divine connection and movement by the divine will. Being conducted by divine will, material nature, although inferior, acts so wonderfully in the construction and destruction of the cosmic manifestation. The Vedas confirm this as follows:mayamtuprakritimvidyanmayinamtumahesvaram. \"Althoughmaya[illusion] is false or temporary, the background ofmayais the supreme magician, the Personality of Godhead, who isMahesvara, the supreme controller.\" (SvetasvataraUpanishad4.10)"

                    "commentary": "The living entity, while executing devotional service or transcendental rituals after many, many births, may actually become situated in transcendental pure knowledge that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of spiritual realization. In the beginning of spiritual realization, while one is trying to give up one's attachment to materialism, there is some leaning towards impersonalism, but when one is further advanced he can understand that there are activities in the spiritual life and that these activities constitute devotional service. Realizing this, he becomes attached to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and surrenders to Him. At such a time one can understand that LordSriKrishna's mercy is everything, that He is the cause of all causes and that this material manifestation is not independent from Him. He realizes the material world to be a perverted reflection of spiritual variegatedness and realizes that in everything there is a relationship with the Supreme LordKrishna. Thus he thinks of everything in relation toVasudeva, orSriKrishna. Such a universal vision ofVasudevaprecipitates one's full surrender to the Supreme LordSriKrishnaas the highest goal. Such surrendered great souls are very rare."

As the supreme father of all living entities, He does not interfere with their independence, but gives all facilities so that they can fulfill their material desires. Some may ask why the all-powerful God gives facilities to the living entities for enjoying this material world and so lets them fall into the trap of the illusory energy. The answer is that if the Supreme Lord as Supersoul does not give such facilities, then there is no meaning to independence. Therefore He gives everyone full independence -- whatever one likes -- but His ultimate instruction we find in the Bhagavad-gita: one should give up all other engagements and fully surrender unto Him.

The living entity may forget that everything is the property of the Supreme Lord, but the demigods do not forget. So the worship of demigods and achievement of desired results are due not to the demigods but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by arrangement. The less intelligent living entity does not know this, and therefore he foolishly goes to the demigods for some benefit. But the pure devotee, when in need of something, prays only to the Supreme Lord. Asking for material benefit, however, is not a sign of a pure devotee. A living entity goes to the demigods usually because he is mad to fulfill his lust. This happens when something undue is desired by the living entity and the Lord Himself does not fulfill the desire. In theCaitanya-caritamritait is said that one who worships the Supreme Lord and at the same time desires material enjoyment is contradictory in his desires. Devotional service to the Supreme Lord and the worship of a demigod cannot be on the same platform, because worship of a demigod is material and devotional service to the Supreme Lord is completely spiritual."

                    "commentary": "Persons acting inKrishnaconsciousness are never deviated from the path of entirely understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the transcendental association ofKrishnaconsciousness, one can understand how the Supreme Lord is the governing principle of the material manifestation and even of the demigods. Gradually, by such transcendental association, one becomes convinced of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and at the time of death such aKrishnaconscious person can never forgetKrishna. Naturally he is thus promoted to the planet of the Supreme Lord,GolokaVrindavana."

                    "commentary": "The physical nature is constantly changing. Material bodies generally pass through six stages: they are born, they grow, they remain for some duration, they produce some by-products, they dwindle, and then they vanish. This physical nature is calledadhibhuta. It is created at a certain point and will be annihilated at a certain point. The conception of the universal form of the Supreme Lord, which includes all the demigods and their different planets, is called adhidaivata. And present in the body along with the individual soul is the Supersoul, a plenary representation of LordKrishna. The Supersoul is called theParamatmaoradhiyajnaand is situated in the heart. The wordevais particularly important in the context of this verse because by this word the Lord stresses that theParamatmais not different from Him. The Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, seated beside the individual soul, is the witness of the individual soul's activities and is the source of the soul's various types of consciousness. The Supersoul gives the individual soul an opportunity to act freely and witnesses his activities. The functions of all these different manifestations of the Supreme Lord automatically become clarified for the pureKrishnaconscious devotee engaged in transcendental service to the Lord. The gigantic universal form of the Lord called adhidaivata is contemplated by the neophyte who cannot approach the Supreme Lord in His manifestation as Supersoul. The neophyte is advised to contemplate the universal form, orvirat-purusha, whose legs are considered the lower planets, whose eyes are considered the sun and moon, and whose head is considered the upper planetary system."

Remembrance ofKrishnais not possible for the impure soul who has not practicedKrishnaconsciousness in devotional service. Therefore one should practiceKrishnaconsciousness from the very beginning of life. If one wants to achieve success at the end of his life, the process of rememberingKrishnais essential.

                    "commentary": "The process of changing one's nature at the critical moment of death is here explained. A person who at the end of his life quits his body thinking ofKrishnaattains the transcendental nature of the Supreme Lord, but it is not true that a person who thinks of something other thanKrishnaattains the same transcendental state. This is a point we should note very carefully. How can one die in the proper state of mind?MaharajaBharata, although a great personality, thought of a deer at the end of his life, and so in his next life he was transferred into the body of a deer. Although as a deer he remembered his past activities, he had to accept that animal body. Of course, one's thoughts during the course of one's life accumulate to influence one's thoughts at the moment of death, so this life creates one's next life. If in one's present life one lives in the mode of goodness and always thinks ofKrishna, it is possible for one to rememberKrishnaat the end of one's life. That will help one be transferred to the transcendental nature ofKrishna. If one is transcendentally absorbed inKrishna's service, then his next body will be transcendental (spiritual), not material. Therefore the chanting ofHareKrishna,HareKrishna,KrishnaKrishna,HareHare/HareRama,HareRama,RamaRama,HareHareis the best process for successfully changing one's state of being at the end of one's life."

One cannot meditate on something impersonal or void. That is very difficult. The process of thinking ofKrishna, however, is very easy and is factually stated herein. First of all, the Lord ispurusha, a person -- we think of the personRamaand the personKrishna. And whether one thinks ofRamaor ofKrishna, what He is like is described in this verse of Bhagavad-gita. The Lord iskavi; that is, He knows past, present and future and therefore knows everything. He is the oldest personality because He is the origin of everything; everything is born out of Him. He is also the supreme controller of the universe, and He is the maintainer and instructor of humanity. He is smaller than the smallest. The living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair, but the Lord is so inconceivably small that He enters into the heart of this particle. Therefore He is called smaller than the smallest. As the Supreme, He can enter into the atom and into the heart of the smallest and control him as the Supersoul. Although so small, He is still all-pervading and is maintaining everything. By Him all these planetary systems are sustained. We often wonder how these big planets are floating in the air. It is stated here that the Supreme Lord, by His inconceivable energy, is sustaining all these big planets and systems of galaxies. The wordacintya(\"inconceivable\") is very significant in this connection. God's energy is beyond our conception, beyond our thinking jurisdiction, and is therefore called inconceivable (acintya). Who can argue this point? He pervades this material world and yet is beyond it. We cannot comprehend even this material world, which is insignificant compared to the spiritual world -- so how can we comprehend what is beyond?Acintyameans that which is beyond this material world, that which our argument, logic and philosophical speculation cannot touch, that which is inconceivable. Therefore intelligent persons, avoiding useless argument and speculation, should accept what is stated in scriptures like the Vedas, Bhagavad-gitaandSrimad-Bhagavatamand follow the principles they set down. This will lead one to understanding."

The practice of shat-cakra-yoga, involving meditation on the six cakras, is suggested here. A pure devotee does not practice suchyoga, but because he is always engaged inKrishnaconsciousness, at death he can remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead by His grace. This is explained in verse fourteen."

                    "commentary": "To practiceyogaas suggested here, one first has to close the doors of all sense enjoyment. This practice is called pratyahara, or withdrawing the senses from the sense objects. The sense organs for acquiring knowledge -- the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and touch -- should be fully controlled and should not be allowed to engage in self-gratification. In this way the mind focuses on the Supersoul in the heart, and the life force is raised to the top of the head. In the Sixth Chapter this process is described in detail. But as mentioned before, this practice is not practical in this age. The best process isKrishnaconsciousness. If one is always able to fix his mind onKrishnain devotional service, it is very easy for him to remain in an undisturbed transcendental trance, or insamadhi."

Different processes of liberation have also been described:karma-yoga,jnana-yogaandhatha-yoga. The principles of theseyogasystems have somebhaktiadded, but this verse particularly mentions purebhakti-yoga, without any mixture ofjnana,karmaorhatha. As indicated by the wordananya-cetah, in purebhakti-yogathe devotee desires nothing butKrishna. A pure devotee does not desire promotion to heavenly planets, nor does he seek oneness with the brahmajyoti or salvation or liberation from material entanglement. A pure devotee does not desire anything. In theCaitanya-caritamritathe pure devotee is callednishkama, which means he has no desire for self-interest. Perfect peace belongs to him alone, not to them who strive for personal gain. Whereas ajnana-yogi,karma-yogiorhatha-yogihas his own selfish interests, a perfect devotee has no desire other than to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the Lord says that for anyone who is unflinchingly devoted to Him, He is easy to attain."

His transcendental form is the most attractive in all the worlds -- His eyes are like lotus petals, and the color of His body is like the color of clouds. He is so attractive that His beauty excels that of thousands of Cupids. He wears saffron cloth, a garland around His neck and a peacock feather in His hair. In the Bhagavad-gitaLordKrishnagives only a small hint of His personal abode,GolokaVrindavana, which is the supermost planet in the spiritual kingdom. A vivid description is given in theBrahma-samhita. Vedic literatures (KathaUpanishad1.3.11) state that there is nothing superior to the abode of the Supreme Godhead, and that that abode is the ultimate destination (purushannaparamkincitsakashthaparamagatih). When one attains to it, he never returns to the material world.Krishna's supreme abode andKrishnaHimself are nondifferent, being of the same quality. On this earth,Vrindavana, ninety miles southeast of Delhi, is a replica of that supremeGolokaVrindavanalocated in the spiritual sky. WhenKrishnadescended on this earth, He sported on that particular tract of land known asVrindavana, comprising about eighty-four square miles in the district ofMathura, India."

All the variegatedness manifest there is of the quality of spiritual bliss -- nothing there is material. That variegatedness is expanded as the spiritual expansion of the Supreme Godhead Himself, for the manifestation there is totally of the spiritual energy, as explained in Chapter Seven. As far as this material world is concerned, although the Lord is always in His supreme abode, He is nonetheless all-pervading by His material energy. So by His spiritual and material energies He is present everywhere -- both in the material and in the spiritual universes. Yasyantah-sthanimeans that everything is sustained within Him, within either His spiritual or material energy. The Lord is all-pervading by these two energies."

The Lord is not directly concerned with the maintenance and sustenance of this material manifestation. Sometimes we see a picture of Atlas holding the globe on his shoulders; he seems to be very tired, holding this great earthly planet. Such an image should not be entertained in connection withKrishna's upholding this created universe. He says that although everything is resting on Him, He is aloof. The planetary systems are floating in space, and this space is the energy of the Supreme Lord. But He is different from space. He is differently situated. Therefore the Lord says, \"Although they are situated on My inconceivable energy, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead I am aloof from them.\" This is the inconceivable opulence of the Lord."

But the Lord is giving an example which may help us to understand. The sky may be the biggest manifestation we can conceive. And in that sky the wind or air is the biggest manifestation in the cosmic world. The movement of the air influences the movements of everything. But although the wind is great, it is still situated within the sky; the wind is not beyond the sky. Similarly, all the wonderful cosmic manifestations are existing by the supreme will of God, and all of them are subordinate to that supreme will. As we generally say, not a blade of grass moves without the will of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus everything is moving under His will: by His will everything is being created, everything is being maintained, and everything is being annihilated. Still He is aloof from everything, as the sky is always aloof from the activities of the wind."

In theBrahma-samhita(5.6) it is stated,atmaramasyatasyastiprakrityanasamagamah: \"He is always involved in His eternal, blissful, spiritual activities, but He has nothing to do with these material activities.\" Material activities are being carried on by His different potencies. The Lord is always neutral in the material activities of the created world. This neutrality is mentioned here with the wordudasina-vat. Although He has control over every minute detail of material activities, He is sitting as if neutral. The example can be given of a high-court judge sitting on his bench. By his order so many things are happening -- someone is being hanged, someone is being put into jail, someone is awarded a huge amount of wealth -- but still he is neutral. He has nothing to do with all that gain and loss. Similarly, the Lord is always neutral, although He has His hand in every sphere of activity. In theVedanta-sutra(2.1.34) it is stated, vaishamya-nairghrinyena: He is not situated in the dualities of this material world. He is transcendental to these dualities. Nor is He attached to the creation and annihilation of this material world. The living entities take their different forms in the various species of life according to their past deeds, and the Lord doesn't interfere with them."

The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation, but the management is being conducted by material nature.Krishnaalso states in Bhagavad-gitathat of all of the living entities in different forms and species, \"I am the father.\" The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in thesmriti: when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities."

For them, the fruit of devotional service -- going back to Godhead -- will never be tasted. Similarly, those who are engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Krishna. In other words, persons who mockKrishnaare to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, such demonic miscreants never surrender toKrishna. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity andKrishnaare one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one withKrishnawill be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse.

The Lord tellsArjunathat those who are purely inKrishnaconsciousness and do not know anything other thanKrishnaare calledmahatma; yet there are other persons who are not exactly in the position ofmahatmabut who worshipKrishnaalso, in different ways. Some of them have already been described as the distressed, the financially destitute, the inquisitive, and those who are engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. But there are others who are still lower, and these are divided into three: (1) he who worships himself as one with the Supreme Lord, (2) he who concocts some form of the Supreme Lord and worships that, and (3) he who accepts the universal form, thevisvarupaof the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worships that. Out of the above three, the lowest, those who worship themselves as the Supreme Lord, thinking themselves to be monists, are most predominant. Such people think themselves to be the Supreme Lord, and in this mentality they worship themselves. This is also a type of God worship, for they can understand that they are not the material body but are actually spiritual soul; at least, such a sense is prominent. Generally the impersonalists worship the Supreme Lord in this way. The second class includes the worshipers of the demigods, those who by imagination consider any form to be the form of the Supreme Lord. And the third class includes those who cannot conceive of anything beyond the manifestation of this material universe. They consider the universe to be the supreme organism or entity and worship that. The universe is also a form of the Lord."

One who does not knowKrishnais misled, and his so-called progressive march is either partial or hallucinatory. There are many who make as their destination different demigods, and by rigid performance of the strict respective methods they reach different planets known as Candraloka, Suryaloka, Indraloka, Maharloka, etc. But all such lokas, or planets, being creations ofKrishna, are simultaneouslyKrishnaand notKrishna.

And sinceKrishnais the source of our generation, or the supreme father, no one can be a better friend thanKrishna, nor can anyone be a better well-wisher.Krishnais the original source of creation and the ultimate rest after annihilation.Krishnais therefore the eternal cause of all causes."

These are vividly described in the fruitive activities portion of the Vedas, which recommends a specific worship of demigods situated on different heavenly planets.

Similarly, one can go to many ghostly planets and become aYaksha,RakshaorPisaca.Pisacaworship is called \"black arts\" or \"black magic.\" There are many men who practice this black art, and they think that it is spiritualism, but such activities are completely materialistic. Similarly, a pure devotee, who worships the Supreme Personality of Godhead only, achieves the planets ofVaikunthaand Krishnaloka without a doubt. It is very easy to understand through this important verse that if by simply worshiping the demigods one can achieve the heavenly planets, or by worshiping the Pitas achieve thePitaplanets, or by practicing the black arts achieve the ghostly planets, why can the pure devotee not achieve the planet ofKrishnaorVishnu? Unfortunately many people have no information of these sublime planets whereKrishnaandVishnulive, and because they do not know of them they fall down. Even the impersonalists fall down from the brahmajyoti. TheKrishnaconsciousness movement is therefore distributing sublime information to the entire human society to the effect that by simply chanting theHareKrishnamantraone can become perfect in this life and go back home, back to Godhead."

                    "commentary": "For the intelligent person, it is essential to be inKrishnaconsciousness, engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, in order to achieve a permanent, blissful abode for eternal happiness. The process of achieving such a marvelous result is very easy and can be attempted even by the poorest of the poor, without any kind of qualification. The only qualification required in this connection is to be a pure devotee of the Lord. It does not matter what one is or where one is situated. The process is so easy that even a leaf or a little water or fruit can be offered to the Supreme Lord in genuine love and the Lord will be pleased to accept it. No one, therefore, can be barred fromKrishnaconsciousness, because it is so easy and universal. Who is such a fool that he does not want to beKrishnaconscious by this simple method and thus attain the highest perfectional life of eternity, bliss and knowledge?Krishnawants only loving service and nothing more.Krishnaaccepts even a little flower from His pure devotee. He does not want any kind of offering from a nondevotee. He is not in need of anything from anyone, because He is self-sufficient, and yet He accepts the offering of His devotee in an exchange of love and affection. To developKrishnaconsciousness is the highest perfection of life.Bhaktiis mentioned twice in this verse in order to declare more emphatically thatbhakti, or devotional service, is the only means to approachKrishna. No other condition, such as becoming abrahmana. a learned scholar, a very rich man or a great philosopher, can induceKrishnato accept some offering. Without the basic principle ofbhakti, nothing can induce the Lord to agree to accept anything from anyone.Bhaktiis never causal. The process is eternal. It is direct action in service to the absolute whole."

                    "commentary": "One may question here that ifKrishnais equal to everyone and no one is His special friend, then why does He take a special interest in the devotees who are always engaged in His transcendental service? But this is not discrimination; it is natural. Any man in this material world may be very charitably disposed, yet he has a special interest in his own children. The Lord claims that every living entity -- in whatever form -- is His son, and so He provides everyone with a generous supply of the necessities of life. He is just like a cloud which pours rain all over, regardless of whether it falls on rock or land or water. But for His devotees, He gives specific attention. Such devotees are mentioned here: they are always inKrishnaconsciousness, and therefore they are always transcendentally situated inKrishna. The very phrase \"Krishnaconsciousness\" suggests that those who are in such consciousness are living transcendentalists, situated in Him. The Lord says here distinctly,mayite: \"They are in Me.\" Naturally, as a result, the Lord is also in them. This is reciprocal. This also explains the wordsyeyathamamprapadyantetams tathaiva bhajamyaham: \"Whoever surrenders unto Me, proportionately I take care of him.\" This transcendental reciprocation exists because both the Lord and the devotee are conscious. When a diamond is set in a golden ring, it looks very nice. The gold is glorified, and at the same time the diamond is glorified. The Lord and the living entity eternally glitter, and when a living entity becomes inclined to the service of the Supreme Lord he looks like gold. The Lord is a diamond, and so this combination is very nice. Living entities in a pure state are called devotees. The Supreme Lord becomes the devotee of His devotees. If a reciprocal relationship is not present between the devotee and the Lord, then there is no personalist philosophy. In the impersonal philosophy there is no reciprocation between the Supreme and the living entity, but in the personalist philosophy there is."

                    "commentary": "The wordsu-duracarahused in this verse is very significant, and we should understand it properly. When a living entity is conditioned, he has two kinds of activities: one is conditional, and the other is constitutional. As for protecting the body or abiding by the rules of society and state, certainly there are different activities, even for the devotees, in connection with the conditional life, and such activities are called conditional. Besides these, the living entity who is fully conscious of his spiritual nature and is engaged inKrishnaconsciousness, or the devotional service of the Lord, has activities which are called transcendental. Such activities are performed in his constitutional position, and they are technically called devotional service. Now, in the conditioned state, sometimes devotional service and the conditional service in relation to the body will parallel one another. But then again, sometimes these activities become opposed to one another. As far as possible, a devotee is very cautious so that he does not do anything that could disrupt his wholesome condition. He knows that perfection in his activities depends on his progressive realization ofKrishnaconsciousness. Sometimes, however, it may be seen that a person inKrishnaconsciousness commits some act which may be taken as most abominable socially or politically. But such a temporary falldown does not disqualify him. In theSrimad-Bhagavatamit is stated that if a person falls down but is wholeheartedly engaged in the transcendental service of the Supreme Lord, the Lord, being situated within his heart, purifies him and excuses him from that abomination. The material contamination is so strong that even ayogifully engaged in the service of the Lord sometimes becomes ensnared; butKrishnaconsciousness is so strong that such an occasional falldown is at once rectified. Therefore the process of devotional service is always a success. No one should deride a devotee for some accidental falldown from the ideal path, for, as explained in the next verse, such occasional falldowns will be stopped in due course, as soon as a devotee is completely situated inKrishnaconsciousness."

One who is not a devotee of the Lord has no good qualifications whatsoever. The question remains, then, How can a person engaged in abominable activities -- either by accident or by intention -- be a pure devotee? This question may justly be raised. The miscreants, as stated in the Seventh Chapter, who never come to the devotional service of the Lord, have no good qualifications, as is stated in theSrimad-Bhagavatam. Generally, a devotee who is engaged in the nine kinds of devotional activities is engaged in the process of cleansing all material contamination from the heart. He puts the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, and all sinful contaminations are naturally washed away. Continuous thinking of the Supreme Lord makes him pure by nature. According to the Vedas, there is a certain regulation that if one falls down from his exalted position he has to undergo certain ritualistic processes to purify himself. But here there is no such condition, because the purifying process is already there in the heart of the devotee, due to his remembering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly. Therefore, the chanting ofHareKrishna,HareKrishna,KrishnaKrishna,HareHare/HareRama,HareRama,RamaRama,HareHareshould be continued without stoppage. This will protect a devotee from all accidental falldowns. He will thus remain perpetually free from all material contaminations."

                    "commentary": "It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower and higher classes of people. In the material conception of life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In theSrimad-Bhagavatam(2.4.18) it is stated that even the lowest, who are called candalas (dog-eaters), can be purified by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and the guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there is no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men; anyone can take to it. The most simple man taking shelter of the pure devotee can be purified by proper guidance. According to the different modes of material nature, men are classified in the mode of goodness (brahmanas), the mode of passion (kshatriyas, or administrators), the mixed modes of passion and ignorance (vaisyas, or merchants), and the mode of ignorance (sudras, or workers). Those lower than them are called candalas, and they are born in sinful families. Generally, the association of those born in sinful families is not accepted by the higher classes. But the process of devotional service is so strong that the pure devotee of the Supreme Lord can enable people of all the lower classes to attain the highest perfection of life. This is possible only when one takes shelter ofKrishna. As indicated here by the wordvyapasritya, one has to take shelter completely ofKrishna. Then one can become much greater than great jnanis and yogis."

His body, His mind and He Himself are one and absolute.

Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understandKrishna; they can understand neither His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why this Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such wonderful, uncommon activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understandKrishna. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understandKrishnaby their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In theSrimad-Bhagavatamalso it is clearly said that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature, or they can imagine something by mental speculation, but it is not possible to understandKrishnaby such foolish speculation."

He at once boldly declares, \"You areparambrahma, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" And previouslyKrishnastated that He is the originator of everything and everyone. Every demigod and every human being is dependent on Him. Men and demigods, out of ignorance, think that they are absolute and independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That ignorance is removed perfectly by the discharge of devotional service. This has already been explained in the previous verse by the Lord. Now, by His grace,Arjunais accepting Him as the Supreme Truth, in concordance with the Vedic injunction. It is not that becauseKrishnaisArjuna's intimate friendArjunais flattering Him by calling Him the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. WhateverArjunasays in these two verses is confirmed by Vedic truth. Vedic injunctions affirm that only one who takes to devotional service to the Supreme Lord can understand Him, whereas others cannot. Each and every word of this verse spoken byArjunais confirmed by Vedic injunction."

He received the authority of Bhagavad-gita. As described in the Fourth Chapter, theparamparasystem of disciplic succession for the understanding of Bhagavad-gitawas lost, and thereforeKrishnareestablished that disciplic succession withArjunabecause He consideredArjunaHis intimate friend and a great devotee. Therefore, as stated in our Introduction to Gitopanishad, Bhagavad-gitashould be understood in theparamparasystem. When theparamparasystem was lost,Arjunawas selected to rejuvenate it. The acceptance byArjunaof all thatKrishnasays should be emulated; then we can understand the essence of Bhagavad-gita, and then only can we understand thatKrishnais the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

                    "commentary": "As it is stated in the previous chapter, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is covered by Hisyoga-maya. Only surrendered souls and devotees can see Him. NowArjunais convinced that His friend,Krishna, is the Supreme Godhead, but he wants to know the general process by which the all-pervading Lord can be understood by the common man. Common men, including the demons and atheists, cannot knowKrishna, because He is guarded by Hisyoga-mayaenergy. Again, these questions are asked byArjunafor their benefit. The superior devotee is concerned not only for his own understanding but for the understanding of all mankind. SoArjuna, out of his mercy, because he is aVaishnava, a devotee, is opening for the common man the understanding of the all-pervasiveness of the Supreme Lord. He addressesKrishnaspecifically asyoginbecauseSriKrishnais the master of theyoga-mayaenergy, by which He is covered and uncovered to the common man. The common man who has no love forKrishnacannot always think ofKrishna; therefore he has to think materially.Arjunais considering the mode of thinking of the materialistic persons of this world. The wordskeshukeshucabhaveshurefer to material nature (the wordbhavameans \"physical things\"). Because materialists cannot understandKrishnaspiritually, they are advised to concentrate the mind on physical things and try to see howKrishnais manifested by physical representations."

The senses of the individual soul are limited and do not permit him to understand the totality ofKrishna's affairs. Still the devotees try to understandKrishna, but not on the principle that they will be able to understandKrishnafully at any specific time or in any state of life. Rather, the very topics ofKrishnaare so relishable that they appear to the devotees as nectar. Thus the devotees enjoy them. In discussingKrishna's opulences and His diverse energies, the pure devotees take transcendental pleasure. Therefore they want to hear and discuss them.Krishnaknows that living entities do not understand the extent of His opulences; He therefore agrees to state only the principal manifestations of His different energies. The wordpradhanyatah(\"principal\") is very important because we can understand only a few of the principal details of the Supreme Lord, for His features are unlimited. It is not possible to understand them all. Andvibhuti, as used in this verse, refers to the opulences by which He controls the whole manifestation. In theAmara-kosadictionary it is stated thatvibhutiindicates an exceptional opulence."

TheGandharvaplanet is filled with entities who sing beautifully, and among them the best singer isCitraratha. Amongst the perfect living entities,Kapila, the son ofDevahuti, is a representative ofKrishna. He is considered an incarnation ofKrishna, and His philosophy is mentioned in theSrimad-Bhagavatam.

Since the Lord is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is present withinArjunahimself; therefore He knows the desire ofArjuna, and He can understand thatArjunahas no special desire to see Him in His universal form, forArjunais completely satisfied to see Him in His personal form ofKrishna. But the Lord can understand also thatArjunawants to see the universal form to convince others.Arjunadid not have any personal desire for confirmation.Krishnaalso understands thatArjunawants to see the universal form to set a criterion, for in the future there would be so many imposters who would pose themselves as incarnations of God.

But if one is engaged in loving transcendental service to the Lord from the beginning, then one can see the Lord by revelation. Every living entity is only a spiritual spark; therefore it is not possible to see or to understand the Supreme Lord.Arjuna, as a devotee, does not depend on his speculative strength; rather, he admits his limitations as a living entity and acknowledgesKrishna's inestimable position.Arjunacould understand that for a living entity it is not possible to understand the unlimited infinite. If the infinite reveals Himself, then it is possible to understand the nature of the infinite by the grace of the infinite. The wordyogesvarais also very significant here because the Lord has inconceivable power. If He likes, He can reveal Himself by His grace, although He is unlimited. ThereforeArjunapleads for the inconceivable grace ofKrishna. He does not giveKrishnaorders.Krishnais not obliged to reveal Himself unless one surrenders fully inKrishnaconsciousness and engages in devotional service. Thus it is not possible for persons who depend on the strength of their mental speculations to seeKrishna."

This word is also very significant. The whole world is moving according to the plan of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Foolish persons who do not have sufficient knowledge think that nature is moving without a plan and all manifestations are but accidental formations. There are many so-called scientists who suggest that perhaps it was like this, or maybe like that, but there is no question of \"perhaps\" and \"maybe.\" There is a specific plan being carried out in this material world. What is this plan? This cosmic manifestation is a chance for the conditioned souls to go back to Godhead, back to home. As long as they have the domineering mentality which makes them try to lord it over material nature, they are conditioned. But anyone who can understand the plan of the Supreme Lord and cultivateKrishnaconsciousness is most intelligent. The creation and destruction of the cosmic manifestation are under the superior guidance of God. Thus the Battle ofKurukshetrawas fought according to the plan of God.Arjunawas refusing to fight, but he was told that he should fight in accordance with the desire of the Supreme Lord. Then he would be happy. If one is in fullKrishnaconsciousness and his life is devoted to the Lord's transcendental service, he is perfect."

His actions are equally good for all.Arjunaunderstood herein that when the Battle ofKurukshetrawas being concluded, in outer space there were present many demigods, siddhas, and the intelligentsia of the higher planets, and they were observing the fight becauseKrishnawas present there. WhenArjunasaw the universal form of the Lord, the demigods took pleasure in it, but others, who were demons and atheists, could not stand it when the Lord was praised. Out of their natural fear of the devastating form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they fled.Krishna's treatment of the devotees and the atheists is praised byArjuna. In all cases a devotee glorifies the Lord because he knows that whatever He does is good for all."

He is the shelter of the whole universe.Arjunaalso thought that it was fitting that all the perfect living entities and powerful demigods offer their respectful obeisances unto Him, because no one is greater than Him.Arjunaespecially mentions thatKrishnais greater thanBrahmabecauseBrahmais created by Him.Brahmais born out of the lotus stem grown from the navel abdomen of GarbhodakasayiVishnu, who isKrishna's plenary expansion; thereforeBrahmaand LordSiva, who is born ofBrahma, and all other demigods must offer their respectful obeisances. It is stated inSrimad-Bhagavatamthat the Lord is respected by LordSivaandBrahmaand similar other demigods. The wordaksharamis very significant because this material creation is subject to destruction but the Lord is above this material creation. He is the cause of all causes, and being so, He is superior to all the conditioned souls within this material nature as well as the material cosmic manifestation itself. He is therefore the all-great Supreme."

That is the constant feature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who knowsKrishnabecomes free at once from all contamination of the material world."

This form was glaring like the sun, and its many faces were rapidly changing.Krishnashowed this form just to satisfy the desire of His friendArjuna. This form was manifested byKrishnathrough His internal potency, which is inconceivable by human speculation. No one had seen this universal form of the Lord beforeArjuna, but because the form was shown toArjuna, other devotees in the heavenly planets and in other planets in outer space could also see it. They had not seen it before, but because ofArjunathey were also able to see it. In other words, all the disciplic devotees of the Lord could see the universal form which was shown toArjunaby the mercy ofKrishna. Someone has commented that this form was shown toDuryodhanaalso whenKrishnawent toDuryodhanato negotiate for peace. Unfortunately,Duryodhanadid not accept the peace offer, but at that timeKrishnamanifested some of His universal forms. But those forms are different from this one shown toArjuna. It is clearly said that no one had ever seen this form before."

It is stated in the Vedic scriptures that those who are devotees of LordVishnuare demigods (vishnu-bhaktahsmritadevah). Those who are atheistic, i.e., who do not believe inVishnu, or who recognize only the impersonal part ofKrishnaas the Supreme, cannot have the divine vision. It is not possible to decryKrishnaand at the same time have the divine vision. One cannot have the divine vision without becoming divine.

ButKrishnasaid that he need not be afraid of killing his grandfather. When the sons ofDhritarashtratried to disrobeDraupadiin the assembly of the Kurus,BhishmaandDronawere silent, and for such negligence of duty they should be killed.Krishnashowed His universal form toArjunajust to show him that these people were already killed for their unlawful action. That scene was shown toArjunabecause devotees are always peaceful and they cannot perform such horrible actions. The purpose of the revelation of the universal form was shown; nowArjunawanted to see the four-armed form, andKrishnashowed him. A devotee is not much interested in the universal form, for it does not enable one to reciprocate loving feelings. Either a devotee wants to offer his respectful worshipful feelings, or he wants to see the two-handedKrishnaform so that he can reciprocate in loving service with the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Similarly,Krishnaknew thatArjunawas not interested in seeing a four-handed form, but sinceArjunaasked to see this four-handed form,Krishnaalso showed him this form again and then showed Himself in His two-handed form. The wordsaumya-vapuhis very significant.Saumya-vapuhis a very beautiful form; it is known as the most beautiful form.

In theBrahma-samhita(5.38) it is stated, premanjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena: only a person whose eyes are smeared with the ointment of love can see the beautiful form ofSriKrishna."

One may be able to see the universal form ofKrishnaby adding a little tinge of devotional service to various activities like penances, Vedic study and philosophical speculation. It may be possible, but without a tinge ofbhaktione cannot see; that has already been explained. Still, beyond that universal form, the form ofKrishnawith two hands is still more difficult to see, even for demigods likeBrahmaand LordSiva. They desire to see Him, and we have evidence in theSrimad-Bhagavatamthat when He was supposed to be in the womb of His mother,Devaki, all the demigods from heaven came to see the marvel ofKrishna, and they offered nice prayers to the Lord, although He was not at that time visible to them. They waited to see Him. A foolish person may deride Him, thinking Him an ordinary person, and may offer respect not to Him but to the impersonal \"something\" within Him, but these are all nonsensical postures.Krishnain His two-armed form is actually desired to be seen by demigods likeBrahmaandSiva."

He explicitly explains this in this verse so that unauthorized commentators, who try to understand Bhagavad-gitaby the speculative process, will know that they are simply wasting their time. No one can understandKrishnaor how He came from parents in a four-handed form and at once changed Himself into a two-handed form. These things are very difficult to understand by study of the Vedas or by philosophical speculation. Therefore it is clearly stated here that no one can see Him or enter into understanding of these matters. Those who, however, are very experienced students of Vedic literature can learn about Him from the Vedic literature in so many ways. There are so many rules and regulations, and if one at all wants to understandKrishna, he must follow the regulative principles described in the authoritative literature. One can perform penance in accordance with those principles. For example, to undergo serious penances one may observe fasting onJanmashtami, the day on whichKrishnaappeared, and on the two days ofEkadasi(the eleventh day after the new moon and the eleventh day after the full moon). As far as charity is concerned, it is plain that charity should be given to the devotees ofKrishnawho are engaged in His devotional service to spread theKrishnaphilosophy, orKrishnaconsciousness, throughout the world.Krishnaconsciousness is a benediction to humanity. LordCaitanyawas appreciated byRupaGosvami as the most munificent man of charity because love ofKrishna, which is very difficult to achieve, was distributed freely by Him. So if one gives some amount of his money to persons involved in distributingKrishnaconsciousness, that charity, given to spreadKrishnaconsciousness, is the greatest charity in the world. And if one worships as prescribed in the temple (in the temples in India there is always some statue, usually ofVishnuorKrishna), that is a chance to progress by offering worship and respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. For the beginners in devotional service to the Lord, temple worship is essential, and this is confirmed in the Vedic literature (SvetasvataraUpanishad6.23):"

Now, here the difference betweenjnana-yogaandbhakti-yogais definitely expressed. The process ofjnana-yoga, although ultimately bringing one to the same goal, is very troublesome, whereas the path ofbhakti-yoga, the process of being in direct service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is easier and is natural for the embodied soul. The individual soul is embodied since time immemorial. It is very difficult for him to simply theoretically understand that he is not the body. Therefore, thebhakti-yogiaccepts the Deity ofKrishnaas worshipable because there is some bodily conception fixed in the mind, which can thus be applied. Of course, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form within the temple is not idol worship. There is evidence in the Vedic literature that worship may be saguna andnirguna-- of the Supreme possessing or not possessing attributes. Worship of the Deity in the temple is saguna worship, for the Lord is represented by material qualities. But the form of the Lord, though represented by material qualities such as stone, wood or oil paint, is not actually material. That is the absolute nature of the Supreme Lord."

How to do this work has already been explained in the fifty-fifth verse of the Eleventh Chapter. One should be sympathetic to the propagation ofKrishnaconsciousness. There are many devotees who are engaged in the propagation ofKrishnaconsciousness, and they require help. So, even if one cannot directly practice the regulative principles ofbhakti-yoga, he can try to help such work. Every endeavor requires land, capital, organization and labor. Just as in business one requires a place to stay, some capital to use, some labor and some organization to expand, so the same is required in the service ofKrishna. The only difference is that in materialism one works for sense gratification. The same work, however, can be performed for the satisfaction ofKrishna, and that is spiritual activity. If one has sufficient money, he can help in building an office or temple for propagatingKrishnaconsciousness. Or he can help with publications. There are various fields of activity, and one should be interested in such activities. If one cannot sacrifice the results of his activities, the same person can still sacrifice some percentage to propagateKrishnaconsciousness. This voluntary service to the cause ofKrishnaconsciousness will help one to rise to a higher state of love for God, whereupon one becomes perfect."

If one attaches himself directly to the activities ofKrishnaconsciousness, there may be objections from family members, or so many other difficulties. For one who has such a problem, it is advised that he sacrifice the accumulated result of his activities to some good cause. Such procedures are described in the Vedic rules. There are many descriptions of sacrifices and special functions ofpunya, or special work in which the result of one's previous action may be applied. Thus one may gradually become elevated to the state of knowledge. It is also found that when one who is not even interested in the activities ofKrishnaconsciousness gives charity to some hospital or some other social institution, he gives up the hard-earned results of his activities. That is also recommended here because by the practice of giving up the fruits of one's activities one is sure to purify his mind gradually, and in that purified stage of mind one becomes able to understandKrishnaconsciousness. Of courseKrishnaconsciousness is not dependent on any other experience, becauseKrishnaconsciousness itself can purify one's mind, but if there are impediments to acceptingKrishnaconsciousness, one may try to give up the results of his actions. In that respect, social service, community service, national service, sacrifice for one's country, etc., may be accepted so that some day one may come to the stage of pure devotional service to the Supreme Lord. In Bhagavad-gita(18.46) we find it is stated,yatahpravrittirbhutanam: if one decides to sacrifice for the supreme cause, even if he does not know that the supreme cause isKrishna, he will come gradually to understand thatKrishnais the supreme cause by the sacrificial method."

So it is better to suffer than to protest.\" In theSrimad-Bhagavatam(10.14.8) it is stated:tatte'nukampam susamikshamano bhunjana evatma-kritamvipakam. Whenever a devotee is in distress or has fallen into difficulty, he thinks that it is the Lord's mercy upon him. He thinks, \"Thanks to my past misdeeds I should suffer far, far greater than I am suffering now. So it is by the mercy of the Supreme Lord that I am not getting all the punishment I am due. I am just getting a little, by the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" Therefore he is always calm, quiet and patient, despite many distressful conditions. A devotee is also always kind to everyone, even to his enemy. Nirmama means that a devotee does not attach much importance to the pains and trouble pertaining to the body because he knows perfectly well that he is not the material body. He does not identify with the body; therefore he is freed from the conception of false ego and is equipoised in happiness and distress. He is tolerant, and he is satisfied with whatever comes by the grace of the Supreme Lord. He does not endeavor much to achieve something with great difficulty; therefore he is always joyful. He is a completely perfect mystic because he is fixed in the instructions received from the spiritual master, and because his senses are controlled he is determined. He is not swayed by false arguments, because no one can lead him from the fixed determination of devotional service. He is fully conscious thatKrishnais the eternal Lord, so no one can disturb him. All these qualifications enable him to fix his mind and intelligence entirely on the Supreme Lord. Such a standard of devotional service is undoubtedly very rare, but a devotee becomes situated in that stage by following the regulative principles of devotional service. Furthermore, the Lord says that such a devotee is very dear to Him, for the Lord is always pleased with all his activities in fullKrishnaconsciousness."

Since a devotee is kind to everyone, he does not act in such a way as to put others into anxiety. At the same time, if others try to put a devotee into anxiety, he is not disturbed. It is by the grace of the Lord that he is so practiced that he is not disturbed by any outward disturbance. Actually because a devotee is always engrossed inKrishnaconsciousness and engaged in devotional service, such material circumstances cannot move him. Generally a materialistic person becomes very happy when there is something for his sense gratification and his body, but when he sees that others have something for their sense gratification and he hasn't, he is sorry and envious. When he is expecting some retaliation from an enemy, he is in a state of fear, and when he cannot successfully execute something he becomes dejected. A devotee who is always transcendental to all these disturbances is very dear toKrishna."

                    "commentary": "Money may be offered to a devotee, but he should not struggle to acquire it. If automatically, by the grace of the Supreme, money comes to him, he is not agitated. Naturally a devotee takes a bath at least twice in a day and rises early in the morning for devotional service. Thus he is naturally clean both inwardly and outwardly. A devotee is always expert because he fully knows the essence of all activities of life and he is convinced of the authoritative scriptures. A devotee never takes the part of a particular party; therefore he is carefree. He is never pained, because he is free from all designations; he knows that his body is a designation, so if there are some bodily pains, he is free. The pure devotee does not endeavor for anything which is against the principles of devotional service. For example, constructing a big building requires great energy, and a devotee does not take to such business if it does not benefit him by advancing his devotional service. He may construct a temple for the Lord, and for that he may take all kinds of anxiety, but he does not construct a big house for his personal relations."

                    "commentary": "A devotee is always free from all bad association. Sometimes one is praised and sometimes one is defamed; that is the nature of human society. But a devotee is always transcendental to artificial fame and infamy, distress or happiness. He is very patient. He does not speak of anything but the topics aboutKrishna; therefore he is called silent. Silent does not mean that one should not speak; silent means that one should not speak nonsense. One should speak only of essentials, and the most essential speech for the devotee is to speak for the sake of the Supreme Lord. A devotee is happy in all conditions; sometimes he may get very palatable foodstuffs, sometimes not, but he is satisfied. Nor does he care for any residential facility. He may sometimes live underneath a tree, and he may sometimes live in a very palatial building; he is attracted to neither. He is called fixed because he is fixed in his determination and knowledge. We may find some repetition in the descriptions of the qualifications of a devotee, but this is just to emphasize the fact that a devotee must acquire all these qualifications. Without good qualifications, one cannot be a pure devotee. Haravabhaktasyakuto mahad-gunah: one who is not a devotee has no good qualification. One who wants to be recognized as a devotee should develop the good qualifications. Of course he does not extraneously endeavor to acquire these qualifications, but engagement inKrishnaconsciousness and devotional service automatically helps him develop them."

Such processes are very dear to the Lord, and He accepts a person engaged in them. The question of who is better -- one who is engaged in the path of impersonalBrahmanor one who is engaged in the personal service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead -- was raised byArjuna, and the Lord replied to him so explicitly that there is no doubt that devotional service to the Personality of Godhead is the best of all processes of spiritual realization. In other words, in this chapter it is decided that through good association one develops attachment for pure devotional service and thereby accepts a bona fide spiritual master and from him begins to hear and chant and observe the regulative principles of devotional service with faith, attachment and devotion and thus becomes engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord. This path is recommended in this chapter; therefore there is no doubt that devotional service is the only absolute path for self-realization, for the attainment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The impersonal conception of the Supreme Absolute Truth, as described in this chapter, is recommended only up to the time one surrenders himself for self-realization. In other words, as long as one does not have the chance to associate with a pure devotee, the impersonal conception may be beneficial. In the impersonal conception of the Absolute Truth one works without fruitive result, meditates and cultivates knowledge to understand spirit and matter. This is necessary as long as one is not in the association of a pure devotee. Fortunately, if one develops directly a desire to engage inKrishnaconsciousness in pure devotional service, he does not need to undergo step-by-step improvements in spiritual realization. Devotional service, as described in the middle six chapters of Bhagavad-gita, is more congenial. One need not bother about materials to keep body and soul together, because by the grace of the Lord everything is carried out automatically."

When he inquired about all these,Krishnasaid that this body is called the field and that one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. This body is the field of activity for the conditioned soul. The conditioned soul is entrapped in material existence, and he attempts to lord it over material nature. And so, according to his capacity to dominate material nature, he gets a field of activity. That field of activity is the body. And what is the body? The body is made of senses. The conditioned soul wants to enjoy sense gratification, and, according to his capacity to enjoy sense gratification, he is offered a body, or field of activity. Therefore the body is calledkshetra, or the field of activity for the conditioned soul. Now, the person, who should not identify himself with the body, is calledkshetra-jna, the knower of the field. It is not very difficult to understand the difference between the field and its knower, the body and the knower of the body. Any person can consider that from childhood to old age he undergoes so many changes of body and yet is still one person, remaining. Thus there is a difference between the knower of the field of activities and the actual field of activities. A living conditioned soul can thus understand that he is different from the body. It is described in the beginning -- dehino 'smin -- that the living entity is within the body and that the body is changing from childhood to boyhood and from boyhood to youth and from youth to old age, and the person who owns the body knows that the body is changing. The owner is distinctlykshetra-jna. Sometimes we think, \"I am happy,\" \"I am a man,\" \"I am a woman,\" \"I am a dog,\" \"I am a cat.\" These are the bodily designations of the knower. But the knower is different from the body. Although we may use many articles -- our clothes, etc. -- we know that we are different from the things used. Similarly, we also understand by a little contemplation that we are different from the body. I or you or anyone else who owns the body is calledkshetra-jna, the knower of the field of activities, and the body is calledkshetra, the field of activities itself."

First He says, \"This is according to different sages.\" As far as the sages are concerned, besides Himself, Vyasadeva (the author of theVedanta-sutra) is a great sage, and in theVedanta-sutraduality is perfectly explained. And Vyasadeva's father,Parasara, is also a great sage, and he writes in his books of religiosity,ahamtvamcatathanye. .. \"we -- you, I and the various other living entities -- are all transcendental, although in material bodies. Now we are fallen into the ways of the three modes of material nature according to our differentkarma. As such, some are on higher levels, and some are in the lower nature. The higher and lower natures exist due to ignorance and are being manifested in an infinite number of living entities. But the Supersoul, which is infallible, is uncontaminated by the three qualities of nature and is transcendental.\" Similarly, in the original Vedas, a distinction between the soul, the Supersoul and the body is made, especially in theKathaUpanishad. There are many great sages who have explained this, andParasarais considered principal among them."

First there are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are the five great elements (maha-bhuta). Then there are false ego, intelligence and the unmanifested stage of the three modes of nature. Then there are five senses for acquiring knowledge: the eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Then five working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus and genitals. Then, above the senses, there is the mind, which is within and which can be called the sense within. Therefore, including the mind, there are eleven senses altogether. Then there are the five objects of the senses: smell, taste, form, touch and sound. Now the aggregate of these twenty-four elements is called the field of activity. If one makes an analytical study of these twenty-four subjects, then he can very well understand the field of activity. Then there are desire, hatred, happiness and distress, which are interactions, representations of the five great elements in the gross body. The living symptoms, represented by consciousness and conviction, are the manifestation of the subtle body -- mind, ego and intelligence. These subtle elements are included within the field of activities."

                    "commentary": "This process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity. But actually this is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the twenty-four elements, as described before. This is actually the means to get out of the entanglement of those elements. The embodied soul is entrapped by the body, which is a casing made of the twenty-four elements, and the process of knowledge as described here is the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important point is described in the first line of the eleventh verse.Mayicananya-yogenabhaktiravyabhicarini: the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So if one does not approach, or is not able to approach, the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other nineteen items are of no particular value. But if one takes to devotional service in fullKrishnaconsciousness, the other nineteen items automatically develop within him. As stated inSrimad-Bhagavatam(5.18.12), yasyasti bhaktir bhagavatyakincanasarvair gunaistatrasamasatesurah. All the good qualities of knowledge develop in one who has attained the stage of devotional service. The principle of accepting a spiritual master, as mentioned in the eighth verse, is essential. Even for one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. The Supreme Personality of Godhead,SriKrishna, clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense."

He exists in His all-pervading form, and in Him exist all the individual living entities, beginning from the first great teacher,Brahma, down to the small ants. There are unlimited heads, legs, hands and eyes, and unlimited living entities. All are existing in and on the Supersoul. Therefore the Supersoul is all-pervading. The individual soul, however, cannot say that he has his hands, legs and eyes everywhere. That is not possible. If he thinks that under ignorance he is not conscious that his hands and legs are diffused all over but when he attains to proper knowledge he will come to that stage, his thinking is contradictory. This means that the individual soul, having become conditioned by material nature, is not supreme. The Supreme is different from the individual soul. The Supreme Lord can extend His hand without limit; the individual soul cannot. In Bhagavad-gitathe Lord says that if anyone offers Him a flower, or a fruit, or a little water, He accepts it. If the Lord is a far distance away, how can He accept things? This is the omnipotence of the Lord: even though He is situated in His own abode, far, far away from earth, He can extend His hand to accept what anyone offers. That is His potency. In theBrahma-samhita(5.37) it is stated,golokaevanivasaty akhilatma-bhutah: although He is always engaged in pastimes in His transcendental planet, He is all-pervading. The individual soul cannot claim that he is all-pervading. Therefore this verse describes the Supreme Soul, the Personality of Godhead, not the individual soul."

The Supreme Lord's senses are not so covered. His senses are transcendental and are therefore callednirguna.Gunameans the material modes, but His senses are without material covering. It should be understood that His senses are not exactly like ours. Although He is the source of all our sensory activities, He has His transcendental senses, which are uncontaminated. This is very nicely explained in the SvetasvataraUpanishad(3.19) in the verseapani-pado javano grahita. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has no hands which are materially contaminated, but He has His hands and accepts whatever sacrifice is offered to Him. That is the distinction between the conditioned soul and the Supersoul. He has no material eyes, but He has eyes -- otherwise how could He see? He sees everything -- past, present and future. He lives within the heart of the living being, and He knows what we have done in the past, what we are doing now, and what is awaiting us in the future. This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gita: He knows everything, but no one knows Him. It is said that the Supreme Lord has no legs like us, but He can travel throughout space because He has spiritual legs. In other words, the Lord is not impersonal; He has His eyes, legs, hands and everything else, and because we are part and parcel of the Supreme Lord we also have these things. But His hands, legs, eyes and senses are not contaminated by material nature."

In the Vedic literature this example is given to show that although He is undivided, He is situated as if divided. Also it is said in Vedic literature that oneVishnuis present everywhere by His omnipotence, just as the sun appears in many places to many persons. And the Supreme Lord, although the maintainer of every living entity, devours everything at the time of annihilation. This was confirmed in the Eleventh Chapter when the Lord said that He had come to devour all the warriors assembled atKurukshetra. He also mentioned that in the form of time He devours also. He is the annihilator, the killer of all. When there is creation, He develops all from their original state, and at the time of annihilation He devours them. The Vedic hymns confirm the fact that He is the origin of all living entities and the rest of all. After creation, everything rests in His omnipotence, and after annihilation everything again returns to rest in Him. These are the confirmations of Vedic hymns.

That is also confirmed in the Vedic literature.Aditya-varnamtamasahparastat(SvetasvataraUpanishad3.8). He is just like the sun, eternally luminous, but He is far, far beyond the darkness of this material world."

Combined, these are calledvijnana, or the science of knowledge. Perfect knowledge can be understood by the unalloyed devotees of the Lord directly. Others are unable to understand. The monists say that at the ultimate stage these three items become one, but the devotees do not accept this. Knowledge and development of knowledge mean understanding oneself inKrishnaconsciousness. We are being led by material consciousness, but as soon as we transfer all consciousness toKrishna's activities and realize thatKrishnais everything, then we attain real knowledge. In other words, knowledge is nothing but the preliminary stage of understanding devotional service perfectly. In the Fifteenth Chapter this will be very clearly explained."

                    "commentary": "The different manifestations of body and senses among the living entities are due to material nature. There are 8,400,000 different species of life, and these varieties are creations of the material nature. They arise from the different sensual pleasures of the living entity, who thus desires to live in this body or that. When he is put into different bodies, he enjoys different kinds of happiness and distress. His material happiness and distress are due to his body, and not to himself as he is. In his original state there is no doubt of enjoyment; therefore that is his real state. Because of the desire to lord it over material nature, he is in the material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The spiritual world is pure, but in the material world everyone is struggling hard to acquire different kinds of pleasures for the body. It might be more clear to state that this body is the effect of the senses. The senses are instruments for gratifying desire. Now, the sum total -- body and instrument senses -- are offered by material nature, and as will be clear in the next verse, the living entity is blessed or damned with circumstances according to his past desire and activity. According to one's desires and activities, material nature places one in various residential quarters. The being himself is the cause of his attaining such residential quarters and his attendant enjoyment or suffering. Once placed in some particular kind of body, he comes under the control of nature because the body, being matter, acts according to the laws of nature. At that time, the living entity has no power to change that law. Suppose an entity is put into the body of a dog. As soon as he is put into the body of a dog, he must act like a dog. He cannot act otherwise. And if the living entity is put into the body of a hog, then he is forced to eat stool and act like a hog. Similarly, if the living entity is put into the body of a demigod, he must act according to his body. This is the law of nature. But in all circumstances, the Supersoul is with the individual soul. That is explained in the Vedas (MundakaUpanishad3.1.1) as follows:dvasuparnasayujasakhayah. The Supreme Lord is so kind upon the living entity that He always accompanies the individual soul and in all circumstances is present as the Supersoul, orParamatma."

It is explained in the Second Chapter that the living entity is transmigrating from one body to another just as one changes dress. This change of dress is due to his attachment to material existence. As long as he is captivated by this false manifestation, he has to continue transmigrating from one body to another. Due to his desire to lord it over material nature, he is put into such undesirable circumstances. Under the influence of material desire, the entity is born sometimes as a demigod, sometimes as a man, sometimes as a beast, as a bird, as a worm, as an aquatic, as a saintly man, as a bug. This is going on. And in all cases the living entity thinks himself to be the master of his circumstances, yet he is under the influence of material nature."

To clarify this, the Lord says that He is represented as theParamatmain every body. He is different from the individual soul; He ispara, transcendental. The individual soul enjoys the activities of a particular field, but the Supersoul is present not as finite enjoyer nor as one taking part in bodily activities, but as the witness, overseer, permitter and supreme enjoyer. His name isParamatma, notatma, and He is transcendental. It is distinctly clear that theatmaandParamatmaare different. The Supersoul, theParamatma, has legs and hands everywhere, but the individual soul does not. And because theParamatmais the Supreme Lord, He is present within to sanction the individual soul's desiring material enjoyment. Without the sanction of the Supreme Soul, the individual soul cannot do anything. The individual isbhukta, or the sustained, and the Lord isbhokta, or the maintainer. There are innumerable living entities, and He is staying in them as a friend."

Those who are atheists, agnostics and skeptics are beyond the sense of spiritual understanding. But there are others, who are faithful in their understanding of spiritual life, and they are called introspective devotees, philosophers, and workers who have renounced fruitive results. Those who always try to establish the doctrine of monism are also counted among the atheists and agnostics. In other words, only the devotees of the Supreme Personality of Godhead are best situated in spiritual understanding, because they understand that beyond this material nature are the spiritual world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is expanded as theParamatma, the Supersoul in everyone, the all-pervading Godhead. Of course there are those who try to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth by cultivation of knowledge, and they can be counted in the class of the faithful. TheSankhyaphilosophers analyze this material world into twenty-four elements, and they place the individual soul as the twenty-fifth item. When they are able to understand the nature of the individual soul to be transcendental to the material elements, they are able to understand also that above the individual soul there is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is the twenty-sixth element. Thus gradually they also come to the standard of devotional service inKrishnaconsciousness. Those who work without fruitive results are also perfect in their attitude. They are given a chance to advance to the platform of devotional service inKrishnaconsciousness. Here it is stated that there are some people who are pure in consciousness and who try to find out the Supersoul by meditation, and when they discover the Supersoul within themselves, they become transcendentally situated. Similarly, there are others who also try to understand the Supreme Soul by cultivation of knowledge, and there are others who cultivate thehatha-yogasystem and who try to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by childish activities."

Some of the people may appear to be atheistic or agnostic or philosophical, but actually there is no knowledge of philosophy. As for the common man, if he is a good soul, then there is a chance for advancement by hearing. This hearing process is very important. LordCaitanya, who preachedKrishnaconsciousness in the modern world, gave great stress to hearing because if the common man simply hears from authoritative sources he can progress, especially, according to LordCaitanya, if he hears the transcendental vibrationHareKrishna,HareKrishna,KrishnaKrishna,HareHare/HareRama,HareRama,RamaRama,HareHare. It is stated, therefore, that all men should take advantage of hearing from realized souls and gradually become able to understand everything. The worship of the Supreme Lord will then undoubtedly take place. LordCaitanyahas said that in this age no one needs to change his position, but one should give up the endeavor to understand the Absolute Truth by speculative reasoning. One should learn to become the servant of those who are in knowledge of the Supreme Lord. If one is fortunate enough to take shelter of a pure devotee, hear from him about self-realization and follow in his footsteps, one will be gradually elevated to the position of a pure devotee. In this verse particularly, the process of hearing is strongly recommended, and this is very appropriate. Although the common man is often not as capable as so-called philosophers, faithful hearing from an authoritative person will help one transcend this material existence and go back to Godhead, back to home."

This material differentiation is due to a material conception of life. After the destruction of the material body, the spirit soul is one. The spirit soul, due to contact with material nature, gets different types of bodies.

As the sun is situated in one place but is illuminating the whole universe, so a small particle of spirit soul, although situated in the heart of this body, is illuminating the whole body by consciousness. Thus consciousness is the proof of the presence of the soul, as sunshine or light is the proof of the presence of the sun. When the soul is present in the body, there is consciousness all over the body, and as soon as the soul has passed from the body there is no more consciousness. This can be easily understood by any intelligent man. Therefore consciousness is not a product of the combinations of matter. It is the symptom of the living entity. The consciousness of the living entity, although qualitatively one with the supreme consciousness, is not supreme, because the consciousness of one particular body does not share that of another body. But the Supersoul, which is situated in all bodies as the friend of the individual soul, is conscious of all bodies.

In the Thirteenth Chapter, it was clearly explained that by humbly developing knowledge one may possibly be freed from material entanglement. It has also been explained that it is due to association with the modes of nature that the living entity is entangled in this material world. Now, in this chapter, the Supreme Personality explains what those modes of nature are, how they act, how they bind and how they give liberation. The knowledge explained in this chapter is proclaimed by the Supreme Lord to be superior to the knowledge given so far in other chapters. By understanding this knowledge, various great sages attained perfection and transferred to the spiritual world. The Lord now explains the same knowledge in a better way. This knowledge is far, far superior to all other processes of knowledge thus far explained, and knowing this many attained perfection.

                    "commentary": "The living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active, and another is helpless. All these types of psychological manifestations are causes of the entities' conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad-gita. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than those otherwise conditioned. A man in the mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries, and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. The representative type is thebrahmana, who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that, in the mode of goodness, one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually, in the Vedic literature it is said that the mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness."

                    "commentary": "The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man, and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased, one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification, a man in the mode of passion wants some honor in society, or in the nation, and he wants to have a happy family, with nice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standard of the mode of passion. Formerly, the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. If there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness, what to speak of those who are entangled in the mode of passion?"

                    "commentary": "In this verse the specific application of the wordtuis very significant. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness, by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what, but the mode of ignorance is just the opposite. Everyone under the spell of the mode of ignorance becomes mad, and a madman cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of the mode of ignorance is stated in the Vedic literature.Vastu-yathatmya-jnanavarakamviparyaya-jnana-janakamtamah: under the spell of ignorance, one cannot understand a thing as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die; man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still, people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night, not caring for the eternal spirit. This is madness. In their madness, they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy. When they are invited to associate for spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. They are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded in the mode of ignorance is that he sleeps more than is required. Six hours of sleep is sufficient, but a man in the mode of ignorance sleeps at least ten or twelve hours a day. Such a man appears to be always dejected and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance."

In the mode of ignorance, for example, they do not see that by killing one animal they are taking the chance of being killed by the same animal in the next life. Because people have no education in actual knowledge, they become irresponsible. To stop this irresponsibility, education for developing the mode of goodness of the people in general must be there. When they are actually educated in the mode of goodness, they will become sober, in full knowledge of things as they are. Then people will be happy and prosperous. Even if the majority of the people aren't happy and prosperous, if a certain percentage of the population developsKrishnaconsciousness and becomes situated in the mode of goodness, then there is the possibility for peace and prosperity all over the world. Otherwise, if the world is devoted to the modes of passion and ignorance, there can be no peace or prosperity. In the mode of passion, people become greedy, and their hankering for sense enjoyment has no limit. One can see that even if one has enough money and adequate arrangements for sense gratification, there is neither happiness nor peace of mind. That is not possible, because one is situated in the mode of passion. If one wants happiness at all, his money will not help him; he has to elevate himself to the mode of goodness by practicingKrishnaconsciousness. When one is engaged in the mode of passion, not only is he mentally unhappy, but his profession and occupation are also very troublesome. He has to devise so many plans and schemes to acquire enough money to maintain his status quo. This is all miserable. In the mode of ignorance, people become mad. Being distressed by their circumstances, they take shelter of intoxication, and thus they sink further into ignorance. Their future in life is very dark."

                    "commentary": "One can transcend all the activities of the modes of material nature simply by understanding them properly by learning from the proper souls. The real spiritual master isKrishna, and He is imparting this spiritual knowledge toArjuna. Similarly, it is from those who are fully inKrishnaconsciousness that one has to learn this science of activities in terms of the modes of nature. Otherwise, one's life will be misdirected. By the instruction of a bona fide spiritual master, a living entity can know of his spiritual position, his material body, his senses, how he is entrapped, and how he is under the spell of the material modes of nature. He is helpless, being in the grip of these modes, but when he can see his real position, then he can attain to the transcendental platform, having the scope for spiritual life. Actually, the living entity is not the performer of different activities. He is forced to act because he is situated in a particular type of body, conducted by some particular mode of material nature. Unless one has the help of spiritual authority, he cannot understand in what position he is actually situated. With the association of a bona fide spiritual master, he can see his real position, and by such an understanding he can become fixed in fullKrishnaconsciousness. A man inKrishnaconsciousness is not controlled by the spell of the material modes of nature. It has already been stated in the Seventh Chapter that one who has surrendered toKrishnais relieved from the activities of material nature. For one who is able to see things as they are, the influence of material nature gradually ceases."

In other words, devotional service inKrishnaconsciousness is the sign of liberation from material entanglement, and this will be explained in the Eighteenth Chapter. When one is freed from the influence of the modes of material nature, he enters into devotional service."

In these verses,Krishnafirst indicates that a person transcendentally situated has no envy and does not hanker for anything. When a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature. When he is actually out of the body, then he is out of the clutches of the material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten. When one is conscious of the material body, he acts only for sense gratification, but when one transfers the consciousness toKrishna, sense gratification automatically stops. One does not need this material body, and he does not need to accept the dictations of the material body. The qualities of the material modes in the body will act, but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities. How does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body, nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated, the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature."

                    "commentary": "This verse is a reply toArjuna's third question: What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? As explained before, the material world is acting under the spell of the modes of material nature. One should not be disturbed by the activities of the modes of nature; instead of putting his consciousness into such activities, he may transfer his consciousness toKrishnaactivities.Krishnaactivities are known asbhakti-yoga-- always acting forKrishna. This includes not onlyKrishna, but His different plenary expansions such asRamaandNarayana. He has innumerable expansions. One who is engaged in the service of any of the forms ofKrishna, or of His plenary expansions, is considered to be transcendentally situated. One should also note that all the forms ofKrishnaare fully transcendental, blissful, full of knowledge and eternal. Such personalities of Godhead are omnipotent and omniscient, and they possess all transcendental qualities. So if one engages himself in the service ofKrishnaor His plenary expansions with unfailing determination, although these modes of material nature are very difficult to overcome, one can overcome them easily. This has already been explained in the Seventh Chapter. One who surrenders untoKrishnaat once surmounts the influence of the modes of material nature. To be inKrishnaconsciousness or in devotional service means to acquire equality withKrishna. The Lord says that His nature is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and the living entities are part and parcel of the Supreme, as gold particles are part of a gold mine. Thus the living entity, in his spiritual position, is as good as gold, as good asKrishnain quality. The difference of individuality continues, otherwise there would be no question ofbhakti-yoga.Bhakti-yogameans that the Lord is there, the devotee is there and the activity of exchange of love between the Lord and the devotee is there. Therefore the individuality of two persons is present in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the individual person, otherwise there would be no meaning tobhakti-yoga. If one is not situated in the same transcendental position with the Lord, one cannot serve the Supreme Lord. To be a personal assistant to a king, one must acquire the qualifications. Thus the qualification is to becomeBrahman, or freed from all material contamination. It is said in the Vedic literature, brahmaivasanbrahmapyeti. One can attain the SupremeBrahmanby becomingBrahman. This means that one must qualitatively become one withBrahman. By attainment ofBrahman, one does not lose his eternalBrahmanidentity as an individual soul."

Therefore, bothParamatmaand the impersonalBrahmanare within the Supreme Person. It is explained in the Seventh Chapter that material nature is the manifestation of the inferior energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord impregnates the inferior, material nature with fragments of the superior nature, and that is the spiritual touch in the material nature. When a living entity conditioned by this material nature begins the cultivation of spiritual knowledge, he elevates himself from the position of material existence and gradually rises up to theBrahmanconception of the Supreme. This attainment of theBrahmanconception of life is the first stage in self-realization. At this stage theBrahman-realized person is transcendental to the material position, but he is not actually perfect inBrahmanrealization. If he wants, he can continue to stay in theBrahmanposition and then gradually rise up toParamatmarealization and then to the realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are many examples of this in Vedic literature. The four Kumaras were situated first in the impersonalBrahmanconception of truth, but then they graduallyroseto the platform of devotional service. One who cannot elevate himself beyond the impersonal conception ofBrahmanruns the risk of falling down. InSrimad-Bhagavatamit is stated that although a person may rise to the stage of impersonalBrahman, without going further, with no information of the Supreme Person, his intelligence is not perfectly clear. Therefore, in spite of being raised to theBrahmanplatform, there is the chance of falling down if one is not engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. In the Vedic language it is also said, rasovaisah,rasamhy evayam labdhvanandibhavati: \"When one understands the Personality of Godhead, the reservoir of pleasure,Krishna, he actually becomes transcendentally blissful.\" (TaittiriyaUpanishad2.7.1) The Supreme Lord is full in six opulences, and when a devotee approaches Him there is an exchange of these six opulences. The servant of the king enjoys on an almost equal level with the king. And so eternal happiness, imperishable happiness, and eternal life accompany devotional service. Therefore, realization ofBrahman, or eternity, or imperishability, is included in devotional service. This is already possessed by a person who is engaged in devotional service."

Finally, in this way, when one reaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that is the end of research work. One has to search out that origin of this tree, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, through the association of persons who are in knowledge of that Supreme Personality of Godhead.

                    "commentary": "The surrendering process is described here very nicely. The first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Because the conditioned soul is puffed up, thinking himself the lord of material nature, it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not lord of material nature; the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride, he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world, it is not possible to surrender to the Supreme Person. Pride is due to illusion, for although one comes here, stays for a brief time and then goes away, he has the foolish notion that he is the lord of the world. He thus makes all things complicated, and he is always in trouble. The whole world moves under this impression. People are considering the land, this earth, to belong to human society, and they have divided the land under the false impression that they are the proprietors. One has to get out of this false notion that human society is the proprietor of this world. When one is freed from such a false notion, he becomes free from all the false associations caused by familial, social and national affections. These faulty associations bind one to this material world. After this stage, one has to develop spiritual knowledge. One has to cultivate knowledge of what is actually his own and what is actually not his own. And when one has an understanding of things as they are, he becomes free from all dual conceptions such as happiness and distress, pleasure and pain. He becomes full in knowledge; then it is possible for him to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

It is not that he assumes individuality in his conditional life and in his liberated state becomes one with the Supreme Lord. He is eternally fragmented. It is clearly said,sanatanah. According to the Vedic version, the Supreme Lord manifests and expands Himself in innumerable expansions, of which the primary expansions are calledvishnu-tattvaand the secondary expansions are called the living entities. In other words, thevishnu-tattvais the personal expansion, and the living entities are the separated expansions. By His personal expansion, He is manifested in various forms like LordRama, Nrisimhadeva, Vishnumurti and all the predominating Deities in theVaikunthaplanets. The separated expansions, the living entities, are eternally servitors. The personal expansions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the individual identities of the Godhead, are always present. Similarly, the separated expansions of living entities have their identities. As fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the living entities also have fragmental portions of His qualities, of which independence is one. Every living entity, as an individual soul, has his personal individuality and a minute form of independence. By misuse of that independence one becomes a conditioned soul, and by proper use of independence he is always liberated. In either case, he is qualitatively eternal, as the Supreme Lord is. In his liberated state he is freed from this material condition, and he is under the engagement of transcendental service unto the Lord; in his conditioned life he is dominated by the material modes of nature, and he forgets the transcendental loving service of the Lord. As a result, he has to struggle very hard to maintain his existence in the material world."

                    "commentary": "Here the living entity is described asisvara, the controller of his own body. If he likes, he can change his body to a higher grade, and if he likes he can move to a lower class. Minute independence is there. The change his body undergoes depends upon him. At the time of death, the consciousness he has created will carry him on to the next type of body. If he has made his consciousness like that of a cat or dog, he is sure to change to a cat's or dog's body. And if he has fixed his consciousness on godly qualities, he will change into the form of a demigod. And if he is inKrishnaconsciousness, he will be transferred to Krishnaloka in the spiritual world and will associate withKrishna. It is a false claim that after the annihilation of this body everything is finished. The individual soul is transmigrating from one body to another, and his present body and present activities are the background of his next body. One gets a different body according tokarma, and he has to quit this body in due course. It is stated here that the subtle body, which carries the conception of the next body, develops another body in the next life. This process of transmigrating from one body to another and struggling while in the body is calledkarshati, or struggle for existence."

This requires a great amount of knowledge understood from Bhagavad-gitaand similar literatures heard from a bona fide spiritual master. One who is trained to perceive all these things is fortunate. Every living entity is quitting his body under certain circumstances, he is living under certain circumstances, and he is enjoying under certain circumstances under the spell of material nature. As a result, he is suffering different kinds of happiness and distress, under the illusion of sense enjoyment. Persons who are everlastingly fooled by lust and desire lose all power to understand their change of body and their stay in a particular body. They cannot comprehend it. Those who have developed spiritual knowledge, however, can see that the spirit is different from the body and is changing its body and enjoying in different ways. A person in such knowledge can understand how the conditioned living entity is suffering in this material existence. Therefore those who are highly developed inKrishnaconsciousness try their best to give this knowledge to the people in general, for their conditional life is very much troublesome.

                    "commentary": "It is understood that all the planets are floating in the air only by the energy of the Lord. The Lord enters into every atom, every planet, and every living being. That is discussed in theBrahma-samhita. It is said there that one plenary portion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Paramatma, enters into the planets, the universe, the living entity, and even into the atom. So due to His entrance, everything is appropriately manifested. When the spirit soul is there, a living man can float on the water, but when the living spark is out of the body and the body is dead, the body sinks. Of course when it is decomposed it floats just like straw and other things, but as soon as the man is dead, he at once sinks in the water. Similarly, all these planets are floating in space, and this is due to the entrance of the supreme energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His energy is sustaining each planet, just like a handful of dust. If someone holds a handful of dust, there is no possibility of the dust's falling, but if one throws it in the air it will fall down. Similarly, these planets, which are floating in the air, are actually held in the fist of the universal form of the Supreme Lord. By His strength and energy, all moving and nonmoving things stay in their place. It is said in the Vedic hymns that because of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the sun is shining and the planets are steadily moving. Were it not for Him, all the planets would scatter, like dust in air, and perish. Similarly, it is due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead that the moon nourishes all vegetables. Due to the moon's influence, the vegetables become delicious. Without the moonshine, the vegetables can neither grow nor taste succulent. Human society is working, living comfortably and enjoying food due to the supply from the Supreme Lord. Otherwise, mankind could not survive. The word rasatmakah is very significant. Everything becomes palatable by the agency of the Supreme Lord through the influence of the moon."

                    "commentary": "According to Ayur-vedicsastra, we understand that there is a fire in the stomach which digests all food sent there. When the fire is not blazing there is no hunger, and when the fire is in order we become hungry. Sometimes when the fire is not going nicely, treatment is required. In any case, this fire is representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Vedic mantras (Brihad-aranyakaUpanishad5.9.1) also confirm that the Supreme Lord orBrahmanis situated in the form of fire within the stomach and is digesting all kinds of foodstuff (ayamagnir vaisvanaro yo 'yamantahpurusheyenedamannampacyate). Therefore since He is helping the digestion of all kinds of foodstuff, the living entity is not independent in the eating process. Unless the Supreme Lord helps him in digesting, there is no possibility of eating. He thus produces and digests foodstuff, and by His grace we are enjoying life. In theVedanta-sutra(1.2.27) this is also confirmed. Sabdadibhyo 'ntah pratishthanacca: the Lord is situated within sound and within the body, within the air and even within the stomach as the digestive force. There are four kinds of foodstuff -- some are swallowed, some are chewed, some are licked up, and some are sucked -- and He is the digestive force for all of them."

The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him, and remembrance is given to him, and he forgets, also, about his past life. Thus, the Lord is not only all-pervading; He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is worshipable not only as the impersonalBrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the localizedParamatma, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The Vedas give the right direction to people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The Vedas offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,Krishna, andKrishnain His incarnation as Vyasadeva is the compiler of theVedanta-sutra. The commentation on theVedanta-sutraby Vyasadeva in theSrimad-Bhagavatamgives the real understanding ofVedanta-sutra. The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul He is the supplier and digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, and the giver of knowledge in the form of Vedas and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead,SriKrishna, the teacher of the Bhagavad-gita. He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all-good; God is all-merciful."

The living entities are eternally separated parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings, or they will descend among the species of animals or even lower life forms.

Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities."

His involvement in the fight was not demoniac, because he was considering the pros and cons. He was considering whether respectable persons such asBhishmaandDronashould be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For akshatriya, a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore there was no cause forArjunato lament. Anyone who performs the regulative principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated."

The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac or asuric. There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of thePrajapati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not."

They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory: that the world has come about in its own way and that there is no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the Supreme Spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying this dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words ofKrishnain Bhagavad-gita: mayadhyakshenaprakritihsuyatesa-caracaram. \"Under My direction the whole material world is moving.\" In other words, among the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of the world; every one of them has some particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions."

They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all.

They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things -- sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The wordasuci-vratah, \"unclean vows,\" is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat-eating; those are theirasuci, unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, by artificial means the world creates a false honor for them.

He is given an opportunity to accumulate such things, but he has no conception of past causes. He simply thinks that all his mass of wealth is due to his own endeavor. A demoniac person believes in the strength of his personal work, not in the law ofkarma. According to the law ofkarma, a man takes his birth in a high family, or becomes rich, or very well educated, or very beautiful because of good work in the past.

Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices, or they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The wordavidhi-purvakam, meaning a disregard for the rules and regulations, is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion."

He is envious of both the scriptures and the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on other bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead, because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God and denies the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power or wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power."

The demoniac person may not agree to accept the supremacy of the Lord, and it is a fact that he may act according to his own whims, but his next birth will depend upon the decision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not on himself. In theSrimad-Bhagavatam, Third Canto, it is stated that an individual soul, after his death, is put into the womb of a mother where he gets a particular type of body under the supervision of superior power. Therefore in the material existence we find so many species of life -- animals, insects, men, and so on. All are arranged by the superior power. They are not accidental. As for the demoniac, it is clearly said here that they are perpetually put into the wombs of demons, and thus they continue to be envious, the lowest of mankind. Such demoniac species of men are held to be always full of lust, always violent and hateful and always unclean. The many kinds of hunters in the jungle are considered to belong to the demoniac species of life."

                    "commentary": "It is known that God is all-merciful, but here we find that God is never merciful to the demoniac. It is clearly stated that the demoniac people, life after life, are put into the wombs of similar demons, and, not achieving the mercy of the Supreme Lord, they go down and down, so that at last they achieve bodies like those of cats, dogs and hogs. It is clearly stated that such demons have practically no chance of receiving the mercy of God at any stage of later life. In the Vedas also it is stated that such persons gradually sink to become dogs and hogs. It may be then argued in this connection that God should not be advertised as all-merciful if He is not merciful to such demons. In answer to this question, in theVedanta-sutrawe find that the Supreme Lord has no hatred for anyone. The placing of the asuras, the demons, in the lowest status of life is simply another feature of His mercy. Sometimes the asuras are killed by the Supreme Lord, but this killing is also good for them, for in Vedic literature we find that anyone who is killed by the Supreme Lord becomes liberated. There are instances in history of many asuras --Ravana,Kamsa, Hiranyakasipu -- to whom the Lord appeared in various incarnations just to kill them. Therefore God's mercy is shown to the asuras if they are fortunate enough to be killed by Him."

By cultivating knowledge of this process, one can be elevated to the highest position of self-realization; this self-realization is perfected in devotional service. In that devotional service, the liberation of the conditioned soul is guaranteed. Therefore, according to the Vedic system, there are instituted the four orders of life and the four statuses of life, called thecastesystem and the spiritual order system. There are different rules and regulations for different castes or divisions of society, and if a person is able to follow them, he will be automatically raised to the highest platform of spiritual realization. Then he can have liberation without a doubt."

In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself.

One who is directly engaged in all these devotional activities is to be understood as having studied all Vedic literature. He has come to the conclusion perfectly. Of course, for the ordinary persons who are not inKrishnaconsciousness or who are not engaged in devotional service, what is to be done and what is not to be done must be decided by the injunctions of the Vedas.

According to scriptural injunction, only the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable, but those who are not very conversant with, or faithful to, the scriptural injunctions worship different objects, according to their specific situations in the modes of material nature. Those who are situated in goodness generally worship the demigods. The demigods includeBrahma,Sivaand others such asIndra,Candraand the sun-god. There are various demigods. Those in goodness worship a particular demigod for a particular purpose. Similarly, those who are in the mode of passion worship the demons. We recall that during the Second World War a man in Calcutta worshiped Hitler because thanks to that war he had amassed a large amount of wealth by dealing in the black market. Similarly, those in the modes of passion and ignorance generally select a powerful man to be God. They think that anyone can be worshiped as God and that the same results will be obtained."

                    "commentary": "There are persons who manufacture modes of austerity and penance which are not mentioned in the scriptural injunctions. For instance, fasting for some ulterior purpose, such as to promote a purely political end, is not mentioned in the scriptural directions. The scriptures recommend fasting for spiritual advancement, not for some political end or social purpose. Persons who take to such austerities are, according to Bhagavad-gita, certainly demoniac. Their acts are against the scriptural injunctions and are not beneficial for the people in general. Actually, they act out of pride, false ego, lust and attachment for material enjoyment. By such activities, not only is the combination of material elements of which the body is constructed disturbed, but also the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself living within the body. Such unauthorized fasting or austerities for some political end are certainly very disturbing to others. They are not mentioned in the Vedic literature. A demoniac person may think that he can force his enemy or other parties to comply with his desire by this method, but sometimes one dies by such fasting. These acts are not approved by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He says that those who engage in them are demons. Such demonstrations are insults to the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they are enacted in disobedience to the Vedic scriptural injunctions. The wordacetasahis significant in this connection. Persons of normal mental condition must obey the scriptural injunctions. Those who are not in such a position neglect and disobey the scriptures and manufacture their own way of austerities and penances. One should always remember the ultimate end of the demoniac people, as described in the previous chapter. The Lord forces them to take birth in the wombs of demoniac persons. Consequently they will live by demoniac principles life after life without knowing their relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If, however, such persons are fortunate enough to be guided by a spiritual master who can direct them to the path of Vedic wisdom, they can get out of this entanglement and ultimately achieve the supreme goal."

In the past, great authorities selected those foods that best aid health and increase life's duration, such as milk products, sugar, rice, wheat, fruits and vegetables. These foods are very dear to those in the mode of goodness. Some other foods, such as baked corn and molasses, while not very palatable in themselves, can be made pleasant when mixed with milk or other foods. They are then in the mode of goodness. All these foods are pure by nature. They are quite distinct from untouchable things like meat and liquor. Fatty foods, as mentioned in the eighth verse, have no connection with animal fat obtained by slaughter. Animal fat is available in the form of milk, which is the most wonderful of all foods. Milk, butter, cheese and similar products give animal fat in a form which rules out any need for the killing of innocent creatures. It is only throughbrutementality that this killing goes on. The civilized method of obtaining needed fat is by milk. Slaughter is the way of subhumans. Protein is amply available through split peas, dal, whole wheat, etc."

One should go to a temple or church as a matter of duty, offer respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and offer flowers and eatables.

                    "commentary": "To make the mind austere is to detach it from sense gratification. It should be so trained that it can be always thinking of doing good for others. The best training for the mind is gravity in thought. One should not deviate fromKrishnaconsciousness and must always avoid sense gratification. To purify one's nature is to becomeKrishnaconscious. Satisfaction of the mind can be obtained only by taking the mind away from thoughts of sense enjoyment. The more we think of sense enjoyment, the more the mind becomes dissatisfied. In the present age we unnecessarily engage the mind in so many different ways for sense gratification, and so there is no possibility of the mind's becoming satisfied. The best course is to divert the mind to the Vedic literature, which is full of satisfying stories, as in the Puranas and the Mahabharata. One can take advantage of this knowledge and thus become purified. The mind should be devoid of duplicity, and one should think of the welfare of all. Silence means that one is always thinking of self-realization. The person inKrishnaconsciousness observes perfect silence in this sense. Control of the mind means detaching the mind from sense enjoyment. One should be straightforward in his dealings and thereby purify his existence. All these qualities together constitute austerity in mental activities."

In every chapter of Bhagavad-gita, LordKrishnastresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service:yoginamapisarvesham. .. \"Of all yogis or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.\" In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the wordsomtatsat, which indicateVishnu, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-gitahas shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past acaryas and theBrahma-sutra, theVedanta-sutra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge ofVedanta-sutra, but actually theVedanta-sutrais meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of theVedanta-sutraand He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, everyVeda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gita."

For instance, it is said that an animal can be killed in a sacrifice, yet some maintain that animal killing is completely abominable. Although animal killing in a sacrifice is recommended in the Vedic literature, the animal is not considered to be killed. The sacrifice is to give a new life to the animal. Sometimes the animal is given a new animal life after being killed in the sacrifice, and sometimes the animal is promoted immediately to the human form of life. But there are different opinions among the sages. Some say that animal killing should always be avoided, and others say that for a specific sacrifice it is good. All these different opinions on sacrificial activity are now being clarified by the Lord Himself."

The marriage ceremony, for example, is considered to be one of these sacrifices. It is calledvivaha-yajna. Should asannyasi, who is in the renounced order of life and who has given up his family relations, encourage the marriage ceremony? The Lord says here that any sacrifice which is meant for human welfare should never be given up.Vivaha-yajna, the marriage ceremony, is meant to regulate the human mind so that it may become peaceful for spiritual advancement. For most men, thisvivaha-yajnashould be encouraged even by persons in the renounced order of life. Sannyasis should never associate with women, but that does not mean that one who is in the lower stages of life, a young man, should not accept a wife in the marriage ceremony. All prescribed sacrifices are meant for achieving the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the lower stages, they should not be given up. Similarly, charity is for the purification of the heart. If charity is given to suitable persons, as described previously, it leads one to advanced spiritual life."

The soul within the body is acting to bring about the results of activity and is therefore known askarta, \"the doer.\" That the soul is the knower and the doer is stated in thesruti.Eshahidrashtasrashta(PrasnaUpanishad4.9). It is also confirmed in theVedanta-sutraby the verses jno 'taeva(2.3.18) andkartasastrarthavattvat (2.3.33). The instruments of action are the senses, and by the senses the soul acts in various ways. For each and every action there is a different endeavor. But all one's activities depend on the will of the Supersoul, who is seated within the heart as a friend. The Supreme Lord is the supercause. Under these circumstances, he who is acting inKrishnaconsciousness under the direction of the Supersoul situated within the heart is naturally not bound by any activity. Those in completeKrishnaconsciousness are not ultimately responsible for their actions. Everything is dependent on the supreme will, the Supersoul, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

If one does not know that a supersanction is there, why should he act? But one who knows the instruments of work, himself as the worker, and the Supreme Lord as the supreme sanctioner is perfect in doing everything. Such a person is never in illusion. Personal activity and responsibility arise from false ego and godlessness, or a lack ofKrishnaconsciousness. Anyone who is acting inKrishnaconsciousness under the direction of the Supersoul or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even though killing, does not kill. Nor is he ever affected by the reaction of such killing. When a soldier kills under the command of a superior officer, he is not subject to be judged. But if a soldier kills on his own personal account, then he is certainly judged by a court of law."

Before one acts, there is some impetus, which is called inspiration. Any solution arrived at before work is actualized is a subtle form of work. Then work takes the form of action. First one has to undergo the psychological processes of thinking, feeling and willing, and that is called impetus. The inspiration to work is the same if it comes from the scripture or from the instruction of the spiritual master. When the inspiration is there and the worker is there, then actual activity takes place by the help of the senses, including the mind, which is the center of all the senses.

Thus the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. This is confirmed in theVedanta-sutra-- janmadyasyayatah[SB 1.1.1]. The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And as stated in the Seventh Chapter of Bhagavad-gita, the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally theVaishnavadevotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord by the expansion of His plenary portion asParamatmais situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of all demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord one has his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in fullKrishnaconsciousness. That is recommended in this verse."

A man who is by nature attracted to the kind of work done by sudras should not artificially claim to be abrahmana, although he may have been born into abrahmanafamily. In this way one should work according to his own nature; no work is abominable, if performed in the service of the Supreme Lord. The occupational duty of abrahmanais certainly in the mode of goodness, but if a person is not by nature in the mode of goodness, he should not imitate the occupational duty of abrahmana. For akshatriya, or administrator, there are so many abominable things; akshatriyahas to be violent to kill his enemies, and sometimes akshatriyahas to tell lies for the sake of diplomacy. Such violence and duplicity accompany political affairs, but akshatriyais not supposed to give up his occupational duty and try to perform the duties of abrahmana."

Similarly, a merchant, however pious he may be, must sometimes hide his profit to stay in business, or he may sometimes have to do business on the black market. These things are necessary; one cannot avoid them. Similarly, even though a man is asudraserving a bad master, he has to carry out the order of the master, even though it should not be done.

Since he is part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the results of his work must be enjoyed by the Supreme Lord. This is actuallyKrishnaconsciousness. The person acting inKrishnaconsciousness is really asannyasi, one in the renounced order of life. By such a mentality, one is satisfied because he is actually acting for the Supreme. Thus he is not attached to anything material; he becomes accustomed to not taking pleasure in anything beyond the transcendental happiness derived from the service of the Lord. Asannyasiis supposed to be free from the reactions of his past activities, but a person who is inKrishnaconsciousness automatically attains this perfection without even accepting the so-called order of renunciation. This state of mind is called yogarudha, or the perfectional stage ofyoga.

                    "commentary": "When one is purified by intelligence, he keeps himself in the mode of goodness. Thus one becomes the controller of the mind and is always in trance. He is not attached to the objects of sense gratification, and he is free from attachment and hatred in his activities. Such a detached person naturally prefers to live in a secluded place, he does not eat more than what he requires, and he controls the activities of his body and mind. He has no false ego because he does not accept the body as himself. Nor has he a desire to make the body fat and strong by accepting so many material things. Because he has no bodily concept of life, he is not falsely proud. He is satisfied with everything that is offered to him by the grace of the Lord, and he is never angry in the absence of sense gratification. Nor does he endeavor to acquire sense objects. Thus when he is completely free from false ego, he becomes nonattached to all material things, and that is the stage of self-realization ofBrahman. That stage is called thebrahma-bhutastage. When one is free from the material conception of life, he becomes peaceful and cannot be agitated. This is described in Bhagavad-gita(2.70):"

                    "commentary": "When one acts inKrishnaconsciousness, he does not act as the master of the world. Just like a servant, one should act fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. A servant has no individual independence. He acts only on the order of the master. A servant acting on behalf of the supreme master is unaffected by profit and loss. He simply discharges his duty faithfully in terms of the order of the Lord. Now, one may argue thatArjunawas acting under the personal direction ofKrishnabut whenKrishnais not present how should one act? If one acts according to the direction ofKrishnain this book, as well as under the guidance of the representative ofKrishna, then the result will be the same. The Sanskrit wordmat-parahis very important in this verse. It indicates that one has no goal in life save and except acting inKrishnaconsciousness just to satisfyKrishna. And while working in that way, one should think ofKrishnaonly: \"I have been appointed to discharge this particular duty byKrishna.\" While acting in such a way, one naturally has to think ofKrishna. This is perfectKrishnaconsciousness. One should, however, note that after doing something whimsically he should not offer the result to the Supreme Lord. That sort of duty is not in the devotional service ofKrishnaconsciousness. One should act according to the order ofKrishna. This is a very important point. That order ofKrishnacomes through disciplic succession from the bona fide spiritual master. Therefore the spiritual master's order should be taken as the prime duty of life. If one gets a bona fide spiritual master and acts according to his direction, then one's perfection of life inKrishnaconsciousness is guaranteed."

The foolish cannot understand this great freedom from all anxiety. For one who acts inKrishnaconsciousness, LordKrishnabecomes the most intimate friend. He always looks after His friend's comfort, and He gives Himself to His friend, who is so devotedly engaged working twenty-four hours a day to please the Lord. Therefore, no one should be carried away by the false ego of the bodily concept of life. One should not falsely think himself independent of the laws of material nature or free to act. He is already under strict material laws. But as soon as he acts inKrishnaconsciousness, he is liberated, free from the material perplexities. One should note very carefully that one who is not active inKrishnaconsciousness is losing himself in the material whirlpool, in the ocean of birth and death. No conditioned soul actually knows what is to be done and what is not to be done, but a person who acts inKrishnaconsciousness is free to act because everything is prompted byKrishnafrom within and confirmed by the spiritual master."

The Supreme Personality gives directions as to what is good and what is bad, and one simply has to act inKrishnaconsciousness to attain the perfection of life. No one can ascertain his destiny as the Supreme Lord can; therefore the best course is to take direction from the Supreme Lord and act. No one should neglect the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or the order of the spiritual master, who is the representative of God.

After changing bodies, the living entity forgets his past deeds, but the Supersoul, as the knower of the past, present and future, remains the witness of all his activities. Therefore all the activities of living entities are directed by this Supersoul. The living entity gets what he deserves and is carried by the material body, which is created in the material energy under the direction of the Supersoul. As soon as a living entity is placed in a particular type of body, he has to work under the spell of that bodily situation. A person seated in a high-speed motorcar goes faster than one seated in a slower car, though the living entities, the drivers, may be the same. Similarly, by the order of the Supreme Soul, material nature fashions a particular type of body to a particular type of living entity so that he may work according to his past desires. The living entity is not independent. One should not think himself independent of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The individual is always under the Lord's control.

In other words, Bhagavad-gitais for the devotees only. But it so happens that sometimes a devotee of the Lord will hold open class, and in that class not all the students are expected to be devotees. Why do such persons hold open class? It is explained here that although not everyone is a devotee, still there are many men who are not envious ofKrishna. They have faith in Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If such persons hear from a bona fide devotee about the Lord, the result is that they become at once free from all sinful reactions and after that attain to the planetary system where all righteous persons are situated. Therefore simply by hearing Bhagavad-gita, even a person who does not try to be a pure devotee attains the result of righteous activities. Thus a pure devotee of the Lord gives everyone a chance to become free from all sinful reactions and to become a devotee of the Lord."

He is meant for self-discipline.SriCaitanyaMahaprabhusays that the actual position of the living entity is that of eternal servant of the Supreme Lord. Forgetting this principle, the living entity becomes conditioned by material nature, but in serving the Supreme Lord he becomes the liberated servant of God. The living entity's constitutional position is to be a servitor; he has to serve either the illusorymayaor the Supreme Lord. If he serves the Supreme Lord he is in his normal condition, but if he prefers to serve the illusory, external energy, then certainly he will be in bondage. In illusion the living entity is serving in this material world. He is bound by his lust and desires, yet he thinks of himself as the master of the world. This is called illusion. When a person is liberated, his illusion is over, and he voluntarily surrenders unto the Supreme to act according to His desires. The last illusion, the last snare ofmayato trap the living entity, is the proposition that he is God. The living entity thinks that he is no longer a conditioned soul, but God. He is so unintelligent that he does not think that if he were God, then how could he be in doubt? That he does not consider. So that is the last snare of illusion. Actually to become free from the illusory energy is to understandKrishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and agree to act according to His order."

There are many mystics and yogis all over the world, butKrishnais the master of allyogasystems.Krishna's instruction is explicitly stated in Bhagavad-gita-- surrender untoKrishna. One who does so is the topmostyogi. This is confirmed in the last verse of the Sixth Chapter.Yoginamapisarvesham."

                    "commentary": "The understanding of Bhagavad-gitais so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics ofArjunaandKrishnabecomes righteous and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears theGitafrom the right source, directly fromKrishna, attains fullKrishnaconsciousness. The result ofKrishnaconsciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment."

It is, of course, said that LordKrishnahad never exhibited such a form before. It was exhibited toArjunaonly, yet some great devotees could also see the universal form ofKrishnawhen it was shown toArjuna, andVyasawas one of them. He is one of the great devotees of the Lord, and he is considered to be a powerful incarnation ofKrishna.Vyasadisclosed this to his discipleSanjaya, who remembered that wonderful form ofKrishnaexhibited toArjunaand enjoyed it repeatedly."

                    "commentary": "The Bhagavad-gitabegan with an inquiry ofDhritarashtra's. He was hopeful of the victory of his sons, assisted by great warriors likeBhishma,DronaandKarna. He was hopeful that the victory would be on his side. But after describing the scene on the battlefield,Sanjayatold the King, \"You are thinking of victory, but my opinion is that whereKrishnaandArjunaare present, there will be all good fortune.\" He directly confirmed thatDhritarashtracould not expect victory for his side. Victory was certain for the side ofArjunabecauseKrishnawas there.Krishna's acceptance of the post of charioteer forArjunawas an exhibition of another opulence.Krishnais full of all opulences, and renunciation is one of them. There are many instances of such renunciation, forKrishnais also the master of renunciation."
